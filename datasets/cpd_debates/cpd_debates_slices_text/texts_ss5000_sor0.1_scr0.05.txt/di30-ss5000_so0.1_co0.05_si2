JOE BIDEN: Just like your rally.
DONALD TRUMP: … when needed. When needed, I wear masks.
WALLACE: Okay. Let me ask-
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen. I will say this-
WALLACE: Vice President Biden, go ahead, sir.
JOE BIDEN: Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able to open. We provided money, the-
WALLACE: But I was asking you, sir, about masks.
JOE BIDEN: Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters.
DONALD TRUMP: And they’ve also said the opposite. They’ve also said-
JOE BIDEN: No serious person has said the opposite. No serious person.
WALLACE: Okay. I want to ask you-
DONALD TRUMP: Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite.
JOE BIDEN: He did not say the opposite.
WALLACE: I want to ask you, we’ve got a little more than a minute left in this segment.
DONALD TRUMP: He said very strongly, “Masks are not good.” Then he changed his mind. He said, “Masks are good.”
WALLACE: I want to ask-
DONALD TRUMP: I’m okay with masks. I’m not fighting masks.
WALLACE: I want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you’re holding large rallies with crowds packed together, thousands of people.
DONALD TRUMP: Outside.
WALLACE: Outside. Yes, sir. Agreed. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with-
DONALD TRUMP: Because nobody will show up.
WALLACE: … people with masks.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, it’s true. Nobody shows up to his rallies.
WALLACE: All right. In any case, why you holding the big rallies? Why you not? You go first, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: Because people want to hear what I have to say. I mean-
WALLACE: But are not worried about us spreading disease?
DONALD TRUMP: … I’ve done a great job as a president, and I’ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people-
WALLACE: Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir?
DONALD TRUMP: Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It’s outside. That’s a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace.
JOE BIDEN: By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had? A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, “No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I’m way far away from those other people.” That’s what he said, “I’m going to be okay.” He’s not worried about you. He’s not worried about the people out there [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP: We’ve had no negative effect.
JOE BIDEN: No negative effect. Come on.
DONALD TRUMP: We’ve had no negative effect, and we’ve had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies.
WALLACE: All right. Do you want to just quickly finish up? Because I want to move on to our next-
JOE BIDEN: Yes, I would. He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. He’s a fool on this.
DONALD TRUMP: If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can’t. Nobody cares.
WALLACE: Gentlemen, can we move on to the-
DONALD TRUMP: Nobody cares.
WALLACE: Gentlemen, can we move on to the economy?
DONALD TRUMP: Yes.
WALLACE: The economy is, I think it’s fair to say, recovering faster than expected from the shutdown-
DONALD TRUMP: Much faster.
WALLACE: … in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth, which is going to be there, is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V-shaped recovery. Vice President Biden, you say it’s more of a K-shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy? President Trump, in this segment you go first.
DONALD TRUMP: So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four-month period that we’ve put back into the workforce. That’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country.
DONALD TRUMP: A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th? Because it’s after the election. They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed. They’re hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up.
DONALD TRUMP: When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It’s not fair. You’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison. And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs. It’s a very, very sad thing. And he’ll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don’t need somebody to come in and say, “Let’s shut it down.”
WALLACE: All right. Your two minutes, sir. We’re now moved to you. As I said, posing the question, the president says it’s a V-shape recovery, you say it’s a K-shaped recovery. What’s the difference?
JOE BIDEN: The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s wrong.
WALLACE: Sir, wait. No. Sir-
DONALD TRUMP: [crosstalk].
WALLACE: Yeah, I understand. You’ve agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have it.
JOE BIDEN: Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history.
JOE BIDEN: Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why doesn’t he take care of the… You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety.
JOE BIDEN: Schools. Why aren’t schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his Administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They’ve done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They’re closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely.
WALLACE: All right. Your time is up, sir. We are going to get to-
DONALD TRUMP: I have to respond to that.
WALLACE: Well, you both had two minutes, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, he made a statement.
WALLACE: And so did you.
DONALD TRUMP: No, people want their schools open. They don’t want to be shut down. They don’t want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It’s so sad what’s happening in New York. It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives.
JOE BIDEN: People want to be safe.
DONALD TRUMP: They’ll be careful, but they want their schools open.
JOE BIDEN: People want to be safe.
DONALD TRUMP: I’m the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I’m very happy to do it-
WALLACE: All right. Let’s-
DONALD TRUMP: … and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When [crosstalk].
WALLACE: Gentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but first, President, as you well know, there’s a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I’m asking you this specific question. Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?
DONALD TRUMP: I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-
JOE BIDEN: Show us your tax returns.
DONALD TRUMP: I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year.
JOE BIDEN: Show us your tax returns.
DONALD TRUMP: You’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company.
WALLACE: Sir, I’m asking you a specific question, which is-
DONALD TRUMP: But let me tell you-
WALLACE: I understand all of that.
JOE BIDEN: Release your tax return.
WALLACE: I understand all of that-
DONALD TRUMP: Let me-
WALLACE: No, President, I’m asking you a question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?
DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars.
WALLACE: You paid millions of dollars in-
DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars, yes.
WALLACE: So not 750?
DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars. And you’ll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it.
JOE BIDEN: When?
DONALD TRUMP: But let me just tell you-
JOE BIDEN: In [crosstalk]?
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We built the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama Administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s-
WALLACE: Vice President Biden, you want to respond?
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s okay.
JOE BIDEN: And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help.
DONALD TRUMP: But why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?
JOE BIDEN: Because you weren’t president-
DONALD TRUMP: Why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?
JOE BIDEN: Because you weren’t president and screwing things up.
DONALD TRUMP: You were a Senator and [crosstalk]-
JOE BIDEN: You’re the worst president America has ever had. Come on.
DONALD TRUMP: Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe. We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing.
WALLACE: Okay. Gentlemen?
DONALD TRUMP: Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts.
WALLACE: President, we’re talking about the economy. I’d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Vice President, your economic plan-
DONALD TRUMP: He has none.
WALLACE: … if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year.
WALLACE: … and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it’s just coming out of a recession.
JOE BIDEN: Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-
WALLACE: But respectfully, sir, I’m talking about taxes, not spending.
JOE BIDEN: By the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn’t be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.
DONALD TRUMP: Why didn’t you do it before, when you were Vice-President with Obama?
JOE BIDEN: Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal.
DONALD TRUMP: I got it done. And you know what happened?
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, you got it done-
DONALD TRUMP: Our economy boomed like it’s never boomed before.
JOE BIDEN: The economy-
WALLACE: President-
JOE BIDEN: Let me finish.
WALLACE: President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?
JOE BIDEN: Not lower tax for the American people.
WALLACE: But let me-
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me.
WALLACE: You talk about the economy booming. It turns out that in Obama’s final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency.
DONALD TRUMP: They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places. [crosstalk] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen.
JOE BIDEN: Look-
WALLACE: Vice President.
JOE BIDEN: … we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it.
DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming.
JOE BIDEN: He blew it.
DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929.
WALLACE: Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-
DONALD TRUMP: When COVID came along.
WALLACE: … when there was record low unemployment before COVID.
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, Chris, wait.
JOE BIDEN: … number one. Number two-
DONALD TRUMP: Chris.
JOE BIDEN: Number three.
DONALD TRUMP: They said it would take… No, you’re on number two.
JOE BIDEN: No.
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, Chris. They said it would take-
JOE BIDEN: This guy-
DONALD TRUMP: … a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing.
JOE BIDEN: We did not. [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: … standard fare.
JOE BIDEN: I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry.
DONALD TRUMP: He totally gave up on manufacturing.
WALLACE: All right, let him-
JOE BIDEN: I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. We brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They’re gone. He blew it. And in fact, they’re gone-
DONALD TRUMP: Ohio had the best year it’s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you. [crosstalk].
