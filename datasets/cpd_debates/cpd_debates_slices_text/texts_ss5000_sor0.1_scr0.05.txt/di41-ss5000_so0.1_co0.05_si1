WILLIAM CLINTON: When the change of government occurred in Israel, the people of Israel were saying we don’t want to abandon the peace process. We want more security. Then a lot of mutual distrust developed. A lot of things happened which maybe shouldn’t have happened. When I asked Yassir Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for three hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace. Again, I’d say if they asked us to play some reasonable role, I don’t know how I would respond. It would depend entirely on what they asked us to do, but the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements they’ve made and find a way to trust each other, and they’re going to have to spend some time and trust each other. Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.
LEHRER: Alright, next question from this section and it is for Senator Dole. Back in the back. Yes, sir, right there. Yes sir.
DELGADO: Senator Dole, Oscar Delgado.
LEHRER: Oscar.
DELGADO: Exsmoker for 30 years. About 30 years ago I was a pack-plus a day man. Okay? You mentioned a statement — you said some time ago that you didn’t think nicotine was addictive. Would you care to — are you still holding to that statement, or do you wish to recant or explain yourself?
ROBERT DOLE: Oh, that’s very easy. My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes. They may be danger — I voted I for everything since that time. In fact, 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or they’re going to lose certain money. We sent it to the Clinton Administration for implementation, and they waited three and a half years. And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking. So you add it up. That’s about three million. Not until again in 1996 — I don’t want anybody to smoke. My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes. I was asked a technical question. Are they addictive? Maybe they — they probably are addictive. I don’t know. I’m not a doctor. You shouldn’t smoke. You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years. And it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use between 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months. Marijuana use is up 141percent. Cocaine use up 160 percent. They’re your kids. It’s all happening in this administration because they cut funding and they cut interdiction. When I’m President of the United States, we’re going to use the National Guard and whatever sources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into America. If you stop the drugs, nobody is going to use the drugs; so don’t smoke, don’t drink, don’t use drugs. Just don’t do it.
WILLIAM CLINTON: Oscar, the question of what the federal government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole and me. We did propose a regulation six months after I became President under the law he mentioned. It simply says all these states — it made it illegal for kids to smoke. Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds. Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments as to how we ought to do it. That’s what drug it out. Meanwhile, we started the — also in ’93 to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market and distribute their products to our kids. No president had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before. I did. Senator Dole opposed me. He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing. I think I did the right thing. On drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you. We have strengthened enforcement, and everybody in San Diego knows we strengthened control of the border. We have done a lot more, and I hope we get a chance to talk about it.
ROBERT DOLE: Well, they also know if they live in San Diego, President, if you’re caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico. You’re not prosecuted. You have a U.S. attorney here that sends `em back home, so I think that’s pretty important. That’s a lot of marijuana. That’s a big supply. But don’t get into this smoke screen here Oscar. The President in the election year decided I ought to do something, I haven’t done anything on drugs. I’ve been AWOL for 44 months, so let’s take on smoking, see they haven’t even done it. They haven’t said what’s going to happen, whether they’re going to have it declared addictive. Once it’s a drug, does it apply only to teenagers or everybody in America? Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young people should not smoke, but my record is there. It’s been there. I’ve voted eight, ten times since 1965.
LEHRER: Next question is for President Clinton. It comes from right here. Yes, sir.
FLECK: President Clinton, my name is Jack Fleck. I’m retired Air Force pilot. Sir, it’s officially forecast that our annual Medicare and Social Security deficits are measured in the trillions of dollars next century. Depending on who you listen to, Social Security will be bankrupted in either 2025 or 2030. I feel this is grossly unfair, especially to our younger generation who are losing faith in the system. My question is this: Assuming you agree that our entitlement programs are on an unsustainable course, what specific reforms do you propose?
WILLIAM CLINTON: First of all, there are two different things. Social Security and Medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities. Let’s talk about them separately. Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century. But we’d like to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life. What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us. And I think what we’ll plainly do is what we did in 1983 when Senator Dole served, and this is something I think he did a good job on when he served on the Social Security commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century. And we will do that. It’s obvious that there are certain things that have to be done and there are 50 or 60 different options, and a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people. Medicare is different. Medicare needs help now. I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund. That’s more than it’s had a lot of the time in the last years. It would save a lot of money through more managed care, by giving more options, more preventative care and lowering the inflation rate and the prices we’re paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and out-of-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide. Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we’re going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire. But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.
ROBERT DOLE: Well again, if you’re somebody thinking about the future, I think it’s fair to say that it’ll be — we’ll work it out. This is a political year, and the President is playing politics with Medicare. After this year is over, we’ll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in `83. It’s a nonpartisan commission. Ronald Reagan got together with Tip O’Neill and Howard Baker, two Republicans and one Democrat. They appointed a commission I was on that commission. We resolved, we rescued Social Security. We suggested — I think it has been over a year ago now — we do the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a gimmick. Now last week I guess it was Donna Shalala said well we’ll cut Medicare a hundred billion and appoint a commission. It will probably have to be done by a commission. Take it out of politics. I think if I were a senior citizen I would be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans and scaring students about education. When you don’t have any ideas, you don’t have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that’s all you can use. We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign and we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.
WILLIAM CLINTON: Their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay $270 more this year. Their idea was a budget that the that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals. Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed. Not in an election year, sir. I told them in early ’95. Senator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people who voted against Medicare and he was proud of it. A year ago he said, “I was right then. I knew it wouldn’t work.” American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world. We need to reform it. Not wreck it.
LEHRER: Next question from here for Senator Dole. Yes, ma’am. Right here. Yes.
GONZALEZ: Senator Dole my name is Susan Gonzalez. And I would like to know what you are — what would be your first step in reforming welfare?
ROBERT DOLE: Well, we’ve taken the first step. Took it three steps, twice we sent welfare reform to the president and he vetoed it. On the third time we sent welfare reform to the president he signed it but announced he would change it next year, and the vice president said they were going to do something else through the line item veto which I’ve never understood, but that’s sort of inside baseball. What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work. And I’m standing here as someone who, a long time ago as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was go through all the welfare checks and sign them. And three of those checks were my grandparents’. So I know what it’s like to have to look welfare head-on. Obviously some people are going to need help. This is the United States of America. You’re not going to go without food and you’re not going to go without medical care. This is America. But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we’re going to provide jobs. We’re going to say you have a five-year limit. You can be on welfare. You got two years to look for a job. We provided more money for daycare in the bill that passed the senate, was vetoed, then it came back and the president signed pretty much the same bill. But this is an important issue. I don’t think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants. It puts a heavy burden on a state like — except for emergencies. It puts a heavy burden on a states like California. It costs California taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year.
LEHRER: President Clinton.
ROBERT DOLE: Let me get out of your way here.
WILLIAM CLINTON: It’s illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits. Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me. I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble. So I’ve been working on it when I was a governor for a long time. When I became president I used the authority I had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work. We reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already. Now, I’ve got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work. It’s very important. And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more. There’s not a more important issue. I, I still remember a woman that I met ten years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell, give an answer when they say, “What does your mother do for a job?” I met that woman again. She’s got four kids. One’s got a good job, one’s studying to be a doctor. One’s in technical school, one’s an honor student in high school. I want to make more people like that woman, Lily Harden, so I’ve got a plan to do it, and it’s just beginning.
ROBERT DOLE: Well another thing we can do. We talk about growth. We’ve got a great economic package which I hope we will discuss later. Across-the-board tax cut. Child credits. $500 per child under 18. Reduce the capital gains rate. Create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare. We have other provisions. Less litigation. The trial lawyers, big supporters of the president. The trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the president vetoes it for them. We’ve got to understand in America that we’ve got to have growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector. The president takes credit for all these people off welfare. The governors did that. Federal government doesn’t do that. And the government doesn’t create jobs. They’re created in the private sector.
LEHRER: This section, question? Yes ma’am. On the back row. This is for the president.
JOHNSON: President. My name is Pamela Johnson and I’m a landlord. My question is, does your party have any future plans to reduce the capital gains tax, especially for retired Americans?
WILLIAM CLINTON: First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes. Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans. We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years. It was part of our other economic plan. And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system. I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can’t have any tax cut that’s not paid for. One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I’m going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend and we’ve worked hard to bring this deficit down and that’s helped people in the real estate business because the interest rates are lower. We’ve got home ownership at a 15-year high. We’ve got this country going in the right direction. So we can have a tax cut but my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a first-time home and helping for health care costs. So from your business, helping in buying a first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about. Thank you, Pamela.
LEHRER: Senator Dole.
ROBERT DOLE: Pam, what the president didn’t tell you is all his tax cuts expire the year 2000, but these increases go on forever. That’s the liberal approach. You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever. So the net tax increase in his plan’s somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars. We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your home’s worth over 500,000 dollars. And if it is, I appreciate it congratulate you. But in any event, no tax. It’s a good idea, they saw it, they picked it up and put it in theirs, but it’s only temporary. Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan. Create jobs and opportunities. Capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it 28 percent to 14 percent. There are 7 trillion dollars in assets locked up in America. If we cut the capital gains rate, I’m told everyday, I had a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas, I can’t, because the capital gains rate’s too high. We need to get the economy going. That’ll help social security. That’ll create more jobs. That’ll help people who want to get off welfare. It’s the American way.
WILLIAM CLINTON: Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he and Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them. We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent. But we have to prove we can pay for them. After he left the senate, we abandoned that. That’s why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates and weaken the economy and that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy. That’s why we have to balance the budget, and I will tell you how I’m going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line. You should expect that from both of us.
LEHRER: All right. The next question is for Senator Dole. Yes, ma’am. Right there.
NAUDIN: My name is Melissa Naudin. I’m a third-year student at UC, San Diego. I just want to say it’s a great honor representing the voices of America. My voice, my question is concerning you, Dole. All the controversy regarding your age. How do you feel you can respond to young voices of America today and tomorrow?
ROBERT DOLE: Well, I think age is very — you know, wisdom comes from age, experience and intelligence. And if you have some of each — and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence — that adds up to wisdom. I think it also is a strength. It’s an advantage. And I have a lot of young people work in my office, work in my campaign. This is about America. This is about, somebody said earlier, one of the first questions, we’re together. It’s one America, one nation. I’m looking at our economic plan because I’m concerned about the future for young people. I’m looking about drugs. The president has been AWOL for four years. I’m looking about crime. He’ll claim credit now for crime going down, but it happens because mayors and governors and others have brought crime down. Rudy Giuliani, Mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City. Of course the president will take credit for that. My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education. This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years. A 50 percent increase. The highest appropriation. 6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important. We also raised the amount of each Pell Grant. In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college.
WILLIAM CLINTON: I can only tell you that I don’t think Senator Dole is too old to be president. It’s the age of his ideas that I question. You’re almost not old enough to remember this. But we tried this before, promising people an election year tax cut that’s not paid for.
ROBERT DOLE: You tried it last time you ran.
WILLIAM CLINTON: Tell him you can have everything you got. And so let me just say this. Did you hear him say that Congress just voted to increase student loans and scholarships? They did after he left. The last budget he led cut Pell Grants, cut student loans. I vetoed it when they shut the government down. My plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of a typical community college tuition. A $10,000 deduction a year for the cost of college tuition. We let families save in an IRA, withdraw tax free to pay for the cost of education and it’s all paid for. My whole administration is about your future. It’s about what the 21st century is going to be like for you. I hope you will look at the ideas in it. Thank you.
