JOE BIDEN: How’s that?
PAUL RYAN: You can — you can cut tax rates by 20 percent and still preserve these important preferences for middle-class taxpayers…
JOE BIDEN: Not mathematically possible.
PAUL RYAN: It is mathematically possible. It’s been done before. It’s precisely what we’re proposing.
JOE BIDEN: It has never been done before.
PAUL RYAN: It’s been done a couple of times, actually.
JOE BIDEN: It has never been done before.
PAUL RYAN: Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth. Ronald Reagan…
JOE BIDEN: Oh, now you’re Jack Kennedy?
(LAUGHTER)
PAUL RYAN: Ronald Reagan — Republicans and Democrats…
JOE BIDEN: This is amazing.
PAUL RYAN: Republican and Democrats have worked together on this.
JOE BIDEN: That’s right.
PAUL RYAN: You know, I understand you guys aren’t used to doing bipartisan deals…
JOE BIDEN: But we told each other what we’re going to do.
PAUL RYAN: Republicans and Democrats…
JOE BIDEN: When we did it Reagan, we said, here — here are the things we’re going to cut.
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: That’s what we said.
PAUL RYAN: We said here’s the framework, let’s work together to fill in the details. That’s exactly…
JOE BIDEN: Fill in the detail.
PAUL RYAN: That’s how you get things done. You work with Congress — look, let me say it this way.
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: That’s coming from a Republican Congress working bipartisanly, 7 percent rating? Come on.
PAUL RYAN: Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, where 87 percent of the legislators he served, which were Democrats. He didn’t demonize them. He didn’t demagogue them. He met with those party leaders every week. He reached across the aisle. He didn’t compromise principles.
JOE BIDEN: And you saw what happened.
PAUL RYAN: He found common ground — and he balanced the budget…
JOE BIDEN: You saw — if he did such a great job…
RADDATZ: Vice President…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: … four times without raising taxes…
JOE BIDEN: Why isn’t he even contesting Massachusetts?
(CROSSTALK)
RADDATZ: Vice President, what would you suggest — what would you suggest beyond raising taxes on the wealthy, that would substantially reduce the long-term deficit?
JOE BIDEN: Just let the taxes expire like they’re supposed to on those millionaires. We don’t — we can’t afford $800 billion going to people making a minimum of $1 million. They do not need it, Martha. Those 120,000 families make $8 million a year. Middle-class people need the help. Why does my friend cut out the tuition tax credit for them? Why does he go after the childcare…
RADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits?
JOE BIDEN: Why do they do that?
RADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits?
PAUL RYAN: Yeah, we’re saying close loopholes…
RADDATZ: Home mortgage deduction?
PAUL RYAN: … on high-interest people.
RADDATZ: Home mortgage deduction?
PAUL RYAN: For higher-income people. Here…
JOE BIDEN: Can you guarantee that no one making less than $100,000 will have a mortgage — their mortgage deduction impacted? Guarantee?
PAUL RYAN: This taxes a million small businesses. He keeps trying to make you think that it’s just some movie star or hedge fund guy or an actor…
JOE BIDEN: Ninety-seven percent of the small businesses make less than $250,000 a year, would not be affected.
PAUL RYAN: Joe, you know it hits a million — this taxes a million people, a million small businesses.
JOE BIDEN: Does it tax 97 percent of the American businesses?
PAUL RYAN: It taxes a million small businesses…
JOE BIDEN: Small businesses?
PAUL RYAN: … who are our greatest job creators.
JOE BIDEN: I wish I’d get — the “greatest job creators” are the hedge fund guys.
RADDATZ: And you’re — and you’re going to increase the defense budget.
PAUL RYAN: Think about it this way.
RADDATZ: And you’re going to increase the defense budget.
PAUL RYAN: No, we’re not just going to cut the defense budget like they’re — they’re proposing…
JOE BIDEN: They’re going to increase it $2 billion.
PAUL RYAN: That’s not…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: We’re talking about… RADDATZ: So no massive defense increases?
PAUL RYAN: No, we’re saying don’t — OK, you want to get into defense now?
RADDATZ: Yes, I do. I do, because that’s another math question.
PAUL RYAN: So — right, OK.
RADDATZ: How do you do that?
PAUL RYAN: So they proposed a $478 billion cut to defense to begin with. Now we have another $500 billion cut to defense that’s lurking on the horizon. They insisted upon that cut being involved in the debt negotiations, and so we have a $1 trillion cut…
RADDATZ: Let’s put the automatic defense cuts aside, OK?
PAUL RYAN: Right, OK.
RADDATZ: Let’s put those aside. No one wants that.
JOE BIDEN: I’d like to go back to that.
RADDATZ: But I want to know how you do the math and have this increase in defense spending?
JOE BIDEN: Two trillion dollars.
PAUL RYAN: You don’t cut defense by a trillion dollars. That’s what we’re talking about.
RADDATZ: And what — what national security issues justify an increase?
JOE BIDEN: Who’s cutting it by $1 trillion?
PAUL RYAN: We’re going to cut 80,000 soldiers, 20,000 Marines, 120 cargo planes. We’re going to push the Joint Strike Fighter out…
RADDATZ: Drawing down in one war and one war…
PAUL RYAN: If these cuts go through, our Navy will be the smallest — the smallest it has been since before World War I.
This invites weakness. Look, do we believe in peace through strength? You bet we do. And that means you don’t impose these devastating cuts on our military.
So we’re saying don’t cut the military by a trillion dollars. Not increase it by a trillion, don’t cut it by a trillion dollars.
RADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President Biden on this. I want to move on.
JOE BIDEN: Look, we don’t cut it. And I might add, this so-called — I know we don’t want to use the fancy word “sequester,” this automatic cut — that was part of a debt deal that they asked for.
And let me tell you what my friend said at a press conference announcing his support of the deal. He said, and I’m paraphrase, We’ve been looking for this moment for a long time.
PAUL RYAN: Can I tell you what that meant?
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: We’ve been looking for bipartisanship for a long time.
JOE BIDEN: And so the bipartisanship is what he voted for, the automatic cuts in defense if they didn’t act.
And beyond that, they asked for another — look, the military says we need a smaller, leaner Army, we need more special forces, we need — we don’t need more M1 tanks, what we need is more UAVs.
RADDATZ: Some of the military.
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: Not some of the military. That was the decision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended to us and agreed to by the president. That is a fact.
RADDATZ: Who answers to a civilian leader.
JOE BIDEN: They made the recommendation first.
RADDATZ: OK. Let’s move on to Afghanistan.
PAUL RYAN: Can I get into that for a second?
RADDATZ: I’d like to move on to Afghanistan please. And that’s one of the biggest expenditures this country has made, in dollars, and more importantly in lives.
We just passed the sad milestone of losing 2,000 U.S. troops there in this war. More than 50 of them were killed this year by the very Afghan forces we are trying to help.
Now, we’ve reached the recruiting goal for Afghan forces, we’ve degraded Al Qaida. So tell me, why not leave now? What more can we really accomplish? Is it worth more American lives?
PAUL RYAN: We don’t want to lose the gains we’ve gotten. We want to make sure that the Taliban does not come back in and give Al Qaida a safe haven.
We agree with the administration on their 2014 transition.
Look, when I think about Afghanistan, I think about the incredible job that our troops have done. You’ve been there more than the two of us combined. First time I was there in 2002, it was amazing to me what they were facing. When I went to the Ahgandah (ph) Valley in Kandahar before the surge, I sat down with a young private in the 82nd from the Monamanee (ph) Indian reservation who would tell me what he did every day, and I was in awe. And to see what they had in front of them.
And then to go back there in December, to go throughout Helmand with the Marines, to see what they had accomplished, it’s nothing short of amazing.
What we don’t want to do is lose the gains we’ve gotten. Now, we’ve disagreed from time to time on a few issues. We would have more likely taken into accounts the recommendations from our commanders, General Petraeus, Admiral Mullen, on troop levels throughout this year’s fighting season. We’ve been skeptical about negotiations with the Taliban, especially while they’re shooting at us.
But we want to see the 2014 transition be successful, and that means we want to make sure our commanders have what they need to make sure that it is successful so that this does not once again become a launching pad for terrorists.
RADDATZ: Vice President Biden?
JOE BIDEN: Martha, let’s keep our eye on the ball. The reason — I’ve been in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq 20 times. I’ve been up in the Konar (ph) Valley. I’ve been throughout that whole country, mostly in a helicopter, and sometimes in a vehicle.
The fact is, we went there for one reason: to get those people who killed Americans, Al Qaida. We’ve decimated Al Qaida central. We have eliminated Osama bin Laden. That was our purpose.
And, in fact, in the meantime, what we said we would do, we would help train the Afghan military. It’s their responsibility to take over their own security. That’s why with 49 of our allies in Afghanistan, we’ve agreed on a gradual drawdown so we’re out of there by the year 20 — in the year 2014.
My friend and the governor say it’s based on conditions, which means it depends. It does not depend for us. It is the responsibility of the Afghans to take care of their own security. We have trained over 315,000, mostly without incident. There have been more than two dozen cases of green-on-blue where Americans have been killed. If we do not — if the measures the military has taken do not take hold, we will not go on joint patrols. We will not train in the field. We’ll only train in the — in the Army bases that exist there.
But we are leaving. We are leaving in 2014. Period. And in the process, we’re going to be saving over the next 10 years another $800 billion. We’ve been in this war for over a decade. The primary objective is almost completed. Now, all we’re doing is putting the Kabul government in a position to be able to maintain their own security.
It’s their responsibility, not America’s.
RADDATZ: What — what conditions could justify staying, Congressman Ryan?
PAUL RYAN: We don’t want to stay. We want — look, one of my best friends in Janesville, a reservist, is at a forward-operating base in eastern Afghanistan right now. Our wives are best friends. Our daughters are best friends. I want — I want him and all of our troops to come home as soon and safely as possible.
We want to make sure that 2014 is successful. That’s why we want to make sure that we give our commanders what they say they need to make it successful. We don’t want to extend beyond 2014. That’s the point we’re making. You know, if it was just this, I’d feel like we would — we would be able to call this a success, but it’s not. What we are witnessing as we turn on our television screens these days is the absolute unraveling of the Obama foreign policy. Problems are growing at home, but — problems are growing abroad, but jobs aren’t growing here at home.
RADDATZ: Let me go back to this. He says we’re absolutely leaving in 2014. You’re saying that’s not an absolute, but you won’t talk about what conditions would justify…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: Do you know why we say that?
JOE BIDEN: I’d like to know…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: Because we don’t want to broadcast to our enemies “put a date on your calendar, wait us out, and then come back.” We want to make sure…
(CROSSTALK)
RADDATZ: But you agree with the timeline.
PAUL RYAN: We do agree — we do agree with the timeline and the transition, but what we — what any administration will do in 2013 is assess the situation to see how best to complete this timeline. What we do not want to do…
JOE BIDEN: We will leave in 2014.
PAUL RYAN: … what we don’t want to do is give our allies reason to trust us less and our enemies more — we don’t want to embolden our enemies to hold and wait out for us and then take over…
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: Martha, that’s a bizarre statement.
PAUL RYAN: That’s why we want to make sure — no, that’s why we want to make sure that…
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: Forty-nine of our allies — hear me — 49 of our allies signed on to this position.
PAUL RYAN: And we’re reading that they want to…
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: Forty-nine — 49 of our allies said “out in 2014.” It’s the responsibility of the Afghans. We have other responsibilities… (CROSSTALK)
RADDATZ: Do you really think that this timeline…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: Which is — which is…
(CROSSTALK)
RADDATZ: We have — we have soldiers and Marines. We have Afghan forces murdering our forces over there. The Taliban is, do you think, taking advantage of this timeline?
JOE BIDEN: Look, the Taliban — what we’ve found out, and we — you saw it in Iraq, Martha, unless you set a timeline, Baghdad, in the case of Iraq, and — and Kabul, in the case of Afghanistan will not step up. They’re happy to let us continue to do the job; international security forces to do the job.
The only way they step up is to say, “Fellas, we’re leaving; we’ve trained you; step up, step up.”
RADDATZ: Let me go back.
JOE BIDEN: That’s the only way it works.
RADDATZ: Let me go back to the — the surge troops that we put in there. And — and you brought this up, Congressman Ryan. I have talked to a lot of troops. I’ve talked to senior offices who were concerned that the surge troops were pulled out during the fighting season, and some of them saw that as a political — as a political move. So can you tell me, Vice President Biden, what was the military reason for bringing those surge troops home…
JOE BIDEN: The military reason…
RADDATZ: … before the fighting had ended?
JOE BIDEN: … was bringing — by the way, when the president announced the surge, you’ll remember, Martha, he said the surge will be out by the end of the summer. The military said the surge will be out. Nothing political about this.
Before the surge occurred — so you be a little straight with me here, too — before the surge occurred, we said they’ll be out by the end of the summer. That’s what the military said. The reason for that is…
RADDATZ: The military follows orders. I mean, there — trust me. There are people who were concerned about pulling out on the fighting season.
JOE BIDEN: Sure. There are people that are concerned, but not the Joint Chiefs. That was their recommendation in the Oval Office to the president of the United States of America. I sat there. I’m sure you’ll find someone who disagrees with the Pentagon. I’m positive you’ll find that within the military. But that’s not the case here.
And, secondly, the reason why the military said that is, you cannot wait and have a cliff. It takes — you know — months and months and months to draw down forces.
PAUL RYAN: Let me…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: Let me try and illustrate the issue here, because I think this — it can get a little confusing. We’ve all met with General Allen and General Scaparrotti in Afghanistan to talk about fighting seasons.
Here’s the way it works. The mountain passes fill in with snow. The Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta Shura come over from Pakistan to fight our men and women. When it fills in with snow, they can’t do it. That’s what we call fighting seasons. In the warm months, fighting gets really high. In the winter, it goes down.
And so when Admiral Mullen and General Petraeus came to Congress and said, if you pull these people out before the fighting season is end, it puts people more at risk. That’s the problem.
Yes, we drew 22,000 troops down last month, but the remaining troops that are there, who still have the same mission to prosecute counterinsurgency, are doing it with fewer people. That makes them less safe.
JOE BIDEN: Fighting season…
PAUL RYAN: We’re sending fewer people out in all of these hotspots to do the same job that they were supposed to do a month ago.
JOE BIDEN: Because we turned it over…
PAUL RYAN: But we took 22,000 people out…
JOE BIDEN: … we turned it over to the Afghan troops we trained. No one got pulled out that didn’t get filled in by trained Afghan personnel. And he’s — he’s conflating two issues. The fighting season that Petraeus was talking about and former — and Admiral Mullen was the fighting season this spring. That’s what he was talking about. We did not — we did not pull them out.
PAUL RYAN: The calendar works the same every year.
JOE BIDEN: It does work the same every year. But we’re not staying there…
PAUL RYAN: Spring, summer, fall. It’s warm, or it’s not. They’re still fighting us. They’re still coming over the passes. They’re still coming into Zabul, to Kunar, to all of these areas, but we are sending fewer people to the front to fight them. And that’s…
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: That’s right, because that’s the Afghan responsibility. We’ve trained them.
PAUL RYAN: Not in the east.
RADDATZ: Let’s move — let’s move to another war.
JOE BIDEN: Not in the east?
PAUL RYAN: R.C. East — R.C. East…
JOE BIDEN: R.C. East is the most dangerous place in the world.
PAUL RYAN: That’s right. That’s why we don’t want to send fewer people to the…
JOE BIDEN: That’s — that’s why we should send Americans in to do the job, instead of the — you’d rather Americans be going in doing the job instead of the trainees?
PAUL RYAN: No. We are already sending Americans to do the job, but fewer of them. That’s the whole problem.
JOE BIDEN: That’s right. We’re sending in more Afghans to do the job, Afghans to do the job.
RADDATZ: Let’s move to another war, the civil war in Syria, where there are estimates that more — estimates that more than 25,000, 30,000 people have now been killed. In March of last year, President Obama explained the military action taken in Libya by saying it was in the national interest to go in and prevent further massacres from occurring there. So why doesn’t the same logic apply in Syria? Vice President Biden?
