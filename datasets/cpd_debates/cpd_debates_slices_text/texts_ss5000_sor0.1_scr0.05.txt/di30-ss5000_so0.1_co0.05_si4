DONALD TRUMP: You just don’t know.
JOE BIDEN: Here’s the deal. I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP: You don’t know.
WALLACE: Let him finish.
JOE BIDEN: The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, uh, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It’s important that people know. Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings. But it’s amazing, it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a self-sense, a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and, and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, and grew up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They look down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re gonna bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on, and we can defeat racism in America.
WALLACE: Vice President… I mean, President Trump, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: During the Obama-Biden Administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at, uh, Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very…many places. Look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened a . . . Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now.
JOE BIDEN: Oh my Lord.
DONALD TRUMP: But the reason-
JOE BIDEN: This is ridiculous.
DONALD TRUMP: … is that the Democrats that run these cities-
JOE BIDEN: Absolutely ridiculous.
DONALD TRUMP: … don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order.
JOE BIDEN: Violent crime. . .
DONALD TRUMP: And you still haven’t mentioned.
JOE BIDEN: Violent crime. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order?
JOE BIDEN: I’m in favor of law. You follow a little bit of order- [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? [crosstalk]
JOE BIDEN: Yes I’m in favor of. . .
WALLACE: You asked a question, let him finish. [crosstalk] Let him answer.
JOE BIDEN: Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly.
DONALD TRUMP: Okay.
JOE BIDEN: And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17 percent, 15 percent in our Administration. It’s gone up on his watch.
WALLACE: Okay.
DONALD TRUMP: It went down much more in ours.
WALLACE: All right, we’re done- [crosstalk] President, you’re going to be very happy because we’re now going to talk about law and order.
DONALD TRUMP: The places we had trouble were Democratic-run cities. . .
WALLACE: That’s exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on Democratic mayors and Democratic governors. But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican-led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?
DONALD TRUMP: I think it’s a party issue. You can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where, uh, 53 people were shot and eight died. Shot. If you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100, 150, 200 percent, uh, crime, it is crazy what’s going on . . .
JOE BIDEN: Republican cities, republican cities.
DONALD TRUMP: . . . and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with. But if he ever got to run this country, and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have. . .
JOE BIDEN: By the way. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . . our suburbs would be gone. By the way, our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before.
JOE BIDEN: He wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn. He was, he was. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I know suburbs so much better than you.
WALLACE: Gentlemen wait a minute.
JOE BIDEN: I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There’s as many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past. What’s, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They’re dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That’s why the suburbs are in trouble.
WALLACE: I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support?
JOE BIDEN: It means. . .
WALLACE: . . . If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call uh, for uh, community control of policing?
JOE BIDEN: Look, what I support is the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding, in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before, where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up. It went down. And so we have to be engaged with . . .
DONALD TRUMP: That’s not what they are talking about, Chris. That’s not what it . . . He’s talking about defunding the police.
JOE BIDEN: That’s exactly. . . that is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: He doesn’t have any law support. He has no law enforcement support.
DONALD TRUMP: Almost nothing.
JOE BIDEN: That’s not true. That’s not. . . Oh, look. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really, who do you have? Name one group that supports you. Name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think. We have time.
JOE BIDEN: We don’t have time to do anything except . . .
DONALD TRUMP: No, no. Think about it. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you.
JOE BIDEN: Folks, folks. . .
WALLACE: Now, gentleman. I think I’m going to take back the moderator’s role. . .
DONALD TRUMP: There aren’t any. I don’t think there are any.
WALLACE: . . . and I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent. In Portland, Oregon, especially we had a, more than a hundred straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Vice-President you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have, though, is as the Democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, “Hey, you gotta stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you’d stop the days and months of violence in Portland.”
JOE BIDEN: I don’t hold public office, now. I am a former Vice-President. I’ve made it clear. I’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted, and anyone who commits it should be prosecuted.
WALLACE: But you’ve never called for the people…
DONALD TRUMP: He’s never done that.
WALLACE: Excuse me, sir. You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call and bring in the National Guard and knock off a 100 days of riots.
JOE BIDEN: They can in fact take care of it if he’d just stay out of the way.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh really? Oh really?
WALLACE: Let, let’s just. . .
DONALD TRUMP: I sent in the US Marshals. . .
JOE BIDEN: Here, here’s the thing. . .
WALLACE: I asked a question. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . .to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street, they shot him. For three days Portland didn’t do anything.
WALLACE: President Trump. President Trump. President Trump. . . I interrupted. President Trump.
DONALD TRUMP: I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business.
WALLACE: Go ahead sir.
JOE BIDEN: And by the way his own former spokesperson said, you know, “Riots and chaos and violence help his cause.” That’s what this is all about.
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t know who said that.
JOE BIDEN: I do.
DONALD TRUMP: Who?
JOE BIDEN: I think it–Kellyanne Conway.
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t think she said that.
JOE BIDEN: She said that.
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t think so.
JOE BIDEN: And so here, here’s the point. The point is that, that’s what he is keep trying to rile everything up. He doesn’t want to calm things down. Instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire. Constantly. At every single solitary time.
WALLACE: Okay. And, and, and to end this, button up this segment, I’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly…
DONALD TRUMP: You mean, I have to answer his stuff?
WALLACE: You have repeatedly…
DONALD TRUMP: His statement?
WALLACE: You have repeatedly. . . No. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Wait a second, you made a statement.
WALLACE: No, you’ve been talking back and forth. I’m asking you.
DONALD TRUMP: I would love to end it. I would love to end it.
WALLACE: I would love to know sir. . . You know sir if you want to switch seats
DONALD TRUMP: . . . we could, very quickly
WALLACE: . . . we can do that.
DONALD TRUMP: I’ll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That’d be no problem. But they don’t want to accept the National Guard.
WALLACE: You have repeatedly criticized the Vice-President for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left-wing extremist groups. But are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland.
DONALD TRUMP: Sure, I’m willing to do that.
WALLACE: Are you prepared specifically to do it. Well go ahead, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: I would say almost everything I see is from the left-wing not from the right wing.
WALLACE: So what are you, what are you saying?
DONALD TRUMP: I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.
WALLACE: Well, do it, sir.
JOE BIDEN: Say it. Do it. Say it.
DONALD TRUMP: You want to call them? What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who would you like me to condemn.
WALLACE: White supremacists and racists.
JOE BIDEN: Proud Boys.
WALLACE: White supremacists and white militias.
JOE BIDEN: Proud Boys.
DONALD TRUMP: Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you what: somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left-wing. This is a left-wing problem. . .
JOE BIDEN: He’s own FBI Director said unlike white supremacists. . .
DONALD TRUMP: This is a left-wing problem.
JOE BIDEN: Antifa is an idea not an organization. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Oh you gotta be kidding.
JOE BIDEN: … not a militia. That’s what his FBI Director said.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, then you know what, he’s wrong.
WALLACE: Gentlemen, gentlemen. No, no, no, we’re done, sir. Moving onto the next… [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: . . . when a bat hits you over the head, that’s not an idea. Antifa is bad.
JOE BIDEN: Everybody in your Administration. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Antifa is bad.
JOE BIDEN: Everybody in your Administration tells you the truth, has a bad idea. You have no idea . . . .
DONALD TRUMP: You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group.
WALLACE: All right, gentlemen we’re now moving onto the Trump and Biden records.
DONALD TRUMP: And you ought to be careful of them, they’ll overthrow you.
WALLACE: I’m going to ask a question. When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but Vice-President Biden, you like to quote one of your dad’s sayings, which is don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I’m going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent? In this segment, President Trump you’ll go first, two minutes.
DONALD TRUMP: Because there has never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you saw what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had to fight, both flanks and behind me and above, there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done. The greatest, before COVID came in, the greatest economy in history, lowest employ–unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going.
And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling, and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we’re building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him. Three hundred and eight thousand people died because they didn’t have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we’ve rebuilt our military.
The job that we’ve done. . . and, and I’ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important. By the end of the first term, I’ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300, and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices. That is a record the likes of which very few people. . . and you know, one of the reasons I’ll have so many judges? Because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill.
When you leave office, you don’t leave any judges. That’s like, you just don’t do that. They left 128 openings, and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I’d say, if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president. You can’t be a good Vice President but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it’ll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It’s a record.
WALLACE: Looking at both of your records. Why should voters elect you President as opposed to President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.
JOE BIDEN: Under this President, we become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided and more violent. When I was Vice President, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy, and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I’ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff. He’s Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.
DONALD TRUMP: Your son got three and a half million dollars.
WALLACE: No, no, no!
JOE BIDEN: By the way, my son…
WALLACE: Wait a minute. President, your campaign agreed to both sides would get two-minute answers, uninterrupted. Well, your, your side agreed to it, and why don’t you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. Okay, sir?
JOE BIDEN: He never keeps his word.
DONALD TRUMP: Can I answer. . .
WALLACE: No! That was a rhetorical question.
JOE BIDEN: Can you add back 30 seconds?
WALLACE: Yes. You may have,
JOE BIDEN: All right.
WALLACE: go ahead.
JOE BIDEN: So thirdly, we’re poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over three to four hundred billion dollars more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less. You’re in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He’s President of the United States. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided, the nation, it can’t stay divided. We can’t be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being, and, and, and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got, he got the Bronze Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot and the people left behind, there, were heroes.
DONALD TRUMP: Really?
JOE BIDEN: And I resent-
DONALD TRUMP: Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter.
JOE BIDEN: I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden, you’re talking about Hunter?
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged. . .
JOE BIDEN: That’s not true he wasn’t dishonorably discharged.
DONALD TRUMP: . . .for cocaine use. And he didn’t have a job until you became Vice-President. Once you became Vice-President
JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.
DONALD TRUMP: . . . he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places.
JOE BIDEN: That is simply not true.
DONALD TRUMP: He made a fortune. . .
JOE BIDEN: My son. . . my son. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . . and he didn’t have a job.
JOE BIDEN: My son. . . like a lot of people. Like a lot of people we know at home had a drug problem. He’s overtaken it. He’s, he’s fixed it. He’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him. I’m proud of my son.
DONALD TRUMP: But why was he given tens of millions of dollars?
WALLACE: Alright. . .
JOE BIDEN: He wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars. [crosstalk]
