TIM KAINE: But they told you there’s a right way and a wrong way to do it.
MICHAEL PENCE: But, look, if you’re going to be critical of me on that, that’s fair game. I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris’ 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state.
TIM KAINE: But, Governor Pence…
MICHAEL PENCE: So you bet I suspended that program.
TIM KAINE: But, Governor Pence, I just…
MICHAEL PENCE: And I stand by that decision. And if I’m vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we’re going to put the safety and security of the American people first.
TIM KAINE: Sure. Can we just be clear — Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we’ll vet refugees based on whether they’re dangerous or not. We won’t do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice.
MICHAEL PENCE: But the problem with that…
TIM KAINE: That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of…[crosstalk]
MICHAEL PENCE: Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can’t know for certain who these people are coming from Syria.
TIM KAINE: Yes, we can, and when we don’t let them know, we don’t let them in.
MICHAEL PENCE: So — the FBI…
TIM KAINE: When we don’t know who they are, we don’t let them in.
MICHAEL PENCE: The FBI and homeland security said we can’t know for certain. You’ve got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator. I understand the…
TIM KAINE: By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims?
MICHAEL PENCE: … the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program…
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, let me ask you this. Secretary Clinton…
MICHAEL PENCE: We’re going to put the safety and security of the American people first.
QUIJANO: … has talked about an intelligence surge.
TIM KAINE: Yes.
QUIJANO: What exactly would an intelligence surge look like? And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization?
TIM KAINE: Intelligence surge is two things, Elaine. It’s two things. It’s, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we’ve got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies.
So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence.
But the second piece of this is really, really important. It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies. And that’s how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come from one country to the next. Alliances are critical.
That’s why Donald Trump’s claim that he wants to — that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.
MICHAEL PENCE: That’s not his plan.
TIM KAINE: Well, he said NATO is obsolete. And, look, if you put aside — push aside your alliances, who you’re going to share intelligence with? Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances. She built the sanctions regime around the world that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. And that’s what an intelligence surge means. Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances.
QUIJANO: All right. I’d like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand…
MICHAEL PENCE: Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all?
QUIJANO: You can — you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please.
MICHAEL PENCE: First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week. We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country. And I look forward if I’m privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort.
TIM KAINE: We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit.
MICHAEL PENCE: We have an intelligence, sir. But I will also tell you that it’s important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it…
QUIJANO: And I don’t — 30 seconds is on up.
MICHAEL PENCE: … about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there.
QUIJANO: Right.
MICHAEL PENCE: Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: I’d like to ask you about Syria, Governor.
MICHAEL PENCE: We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn’t have a private server.
[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: A full investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step. You don’t get to decide the rights and wrongs of this. We have a justice system that does that. And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: All right, we are moving on now. Two hundred fifty thousand people…
MICHAEL PENCE: If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did…
QUIJANO: … one hundred thousand of them children — Governor…
MICHAEL PENCE: … they’d be court martialed.
TIM KAINE: That is absolutely false and you know that.
MICHAEL PENCE: Absolutely true.
TIM KAINE: And you know that, Governor.
QUIJANO: Governor…
MICHAEL PENCE: It’s absolutely true.
QUIJANO: Gentlemen, please.
TIM KAINE: Because the FBI did an investigation.
QUIJANO: Gentlemen.
TIM KAINE: And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further. Sorry.
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please.
TIM KAINE: Syria.
QUIJANO: I want to turn now to Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria. Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries. Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence?
MICHAEL PENCE: The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo. Hillary Clinton’s top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russian reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea.
And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America — the greatest nation on Earth — just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins — look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership.
It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. We’ve got to work with the Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world.
But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen.
And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo.
There’s a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well. We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009.
QUIJANO: Governor, your two minutes are up.
MICHAEL PENCE: We’ve just got to have American strength on the world stage. When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know they’re dealing with a strong American president.
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine?
TIM KAINE: Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern Syria with the provision of international human aid, consistent with the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed in February 2014, would be a very, very good idea.
And Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not. Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. And it’s clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin.
The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces. Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground. He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists. If you don’t know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class.
I’ll tell you what offends me…
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, that offended me.
TIM KAINE: Governor Pence just said — Governor Pence just said that Donald Trump will rebuild the military. No, he won’t. Donald Trump is avoiding paying taxes. The New York Times story — and we need to get this — but the New York Times suggested that he probably didn’t pay taxes for about 18 years starting in 1995. Those years included the years of 9/11.
So get this. On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump’s hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States. Young men and women — young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism. Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight. It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn’t support the fight against terror.
QUIJANO: The question was about Aleppo, Senator.
TIM KAINE: He wouldn’t support troops. He wouldn’t — he wouldn’t support — this is important, Elaine. When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that’s really important.
QUIJANO: Right.
TIM KAINE: And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria. It’s very important.
QUIJANO: Governor Pence, you had mentioned a no-fly zone. Where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically? How would you keep it safe?
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops. Donald Trump supports our veterans.
TIM KAINE: He won’t pay taxes.
MICHAEL PENCE: Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he’s — do you not take deductions? How does that work?
QUIJANO: Gentlemen, this is about Syria. I’d like to…[crosstalk]
MICHAEL PENCE: Honestly, Senator. Honestly, Senator.
TIM KAINE: It is about our troops. It is about our troops.
MICHAEL PENCE: I understand why you want to change — I understand why you want to change the subject.
TIM KAINE: How can you support the troops if you won’t pay taxes?
MICHAEL PENCE: I understand why you want to change the subject. And let me be very clear on this Russian thing. The larger question here…
TIM KAINE: Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes?
QUIJANO: Gentlemen, we’re going to have time to get to Russia here.
MICHAEL PENCE: What we’re dealing with is the — you know, there’s an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates. And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East.
And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we’re not having talks anymore. To answer your question, we just need American strength. We need to — we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm’s way.
QUIJANO: And exactly how would those safe zones work? How would they remain safe?
MICHAEL PENCE: The — the safe zones would have to be — as the senator said, there’s already a framework for this that’s been recognized by the international community. The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone.
But, look, this is very tough stuff. I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade. I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years. I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration…
TIM KAINE: Well, let me — let me come back…
MICHAEL PENCE: … is deeply troubling to me. That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States.
TIM KAINE: … and talk about — let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn’t want to acknowledge, Elaine. He doesn’t want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. He doesn’t want to acknowledge…
MICHAEL PENCE: You didn’t.
TIM KAINE: … that Hillary was part of the team that got bin Laden. He doesn’t want to acknowledge…
MICHAEL PENCE: I just did.
TIM KAINE: … that it’s a good thing, not a bad thing, that it’s a good thing — not a bad thing — that we’re down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000.
But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous. Donald Trump’s idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea. Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s. He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event. And I think that’s who Governor Pence’s running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about.
MICHAEL PENCE: And come on. Senator. Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton. And that — that’s pretty low.
TIM KAINE: But do you — do you think — do you think we should have — more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer?
MICHAEL PENCE: Senator, the…
TIM KAINE: That’s what Donald Trump thinks.
MICHAEL PENCE: Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won. And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence…
TIM KAINE: But can you defend Donald Trump’s claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons?
MICHAEL PENCE: … and assurance to our allies. But let me go back to this Iran thing. I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented — that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: That’s what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now.
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, that’s not what — that’s not what Israel thinks.
TIM KAINE: Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it.
MICHAEL PENCE: You wouldn’t necessarily know that.
TIM KAINE: Go to the tape.
MICHAEL PENCE: I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu’s speech when he came before the Congress.
TIM KAINE: No, I visited him in his office. I visited him in his office.
MICHAEL PENCE: You boycotted the speech. The point is, what this Iran — so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee — I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it — literally in the history of the United States, against Iran.
TIM KAINE: And then Hillary used them to get a deal.
MICHAEL PENCE: We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions.
TIM KAINE: Elaine, let me just mention one thing.
[crosstalk]
MICHAEL PENCE: They have not — Elaine, let me finish a sentence. They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions. And when the deal’s period runs out, there’s no limitation on them obtaining weapons. That…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: And very quickly, Senator.
TIM KAINE: Elaine…
MICHAEL PENCE: … and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment…
QUIJANO: We need to talk about Russia. Very quickly, though, Senator, please.
MICHAEL PENCE: … is astonishing to the American people.
TIM KAINE: Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can’t imagine how you can defend your running mate’s position on one issue after the next. And in all six cases, he’s refused to defend his running mate.
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, let’s — no, no, don’t put words in my mouth.
QUIJANO: All right.
MICHAEL PENCE: He’s going…[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend. And I just think that should be underlined.
MICHAEL PENCE: No, I’m — look…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: All right, gentlemen, let’s talk about Russia. This is a topic that has come up.
MICHAEL PENCE: I’m very, very happy to defend Donald Trump. If he wants to take these one at a time, I’ll take them one at a time.
QUIJANO: I will give you an opportunity to do that.
TIM KAINE: More nations should get nuclear weapons. Try to defend that.
MICHAEL PENCE: Don’t put words in my mouth. Well, he never said that, Senator.
TIM KAINE: He absolutely said it. Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan.
MICHAEL PENCE: Most of the stuff you’ve said, he’s never said.
QUIJANO: Gentlemen, Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime. What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions? Senator Kaine?
TIM KAINE: You’ve got to be tough on Russia. So let’s start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader. Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he’s a great leader. And Donald Trump has business…
MICHAEL PENCE: No, we haven’t.
TIM KAINE: … has business dealings — has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose. Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia. She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia’s nuclear stockpile. She’s had the experience doing it.
She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia. And we’ve done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we’ve put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn’t know that Russia had invaded the Crimea.
MICHAEL PENCE: Oh, that’s nonsense.
TIM KAINE: He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, “I’ll guarantee you this, Russia’s not going into the Ukraine.” And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before.
MICHAEL PENCE: He knew that.
