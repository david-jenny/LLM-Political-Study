DONALD TRUMP: 100 trillion dollars.
JOE BIDEN: The fact is, it’s going to create millions of good-paying jobs. And these tax incentives to people, for people to weatherize, which he wants to get, get rid of. It’s going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we’re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, with, deal with. . . By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may go away.
DONALD TRUMP: I never said that at all.
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, you did say that.
DONALD TRUMP: They made it up.
JOE BIDEN: And here’s the deal. . .
DONALD TRUMP: You make up a lot.
JOE BIDEN: . . . we’re going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. We’re in real trouble. Look what’s happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn’t happen before. They’re because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world’s problem. We in fact, but the rest of the world, we’ve got to get them to come along. That’s why we have to get back into, back into the Paris Accord.
WALLACE: All right, gentlemen. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute, Chris. So why didn’t he do it for 47 years? You were Vice-President?
JOE BIDEN: For 47?
DONALD TRUMP: So why didn’t you get the world—China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars. . .
JOE BIDEN: That is not my plan.
DONALD TRUMP: . . .not 20 billion. . . .
JOE BIDEN: The Green New Deal is not my plan. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . . You want to rebuild every building.
JOE BIDEN: . . . If you knew anything about. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Well, you want to rebuild everything
JOE BIDEN: If he knew anything about. . .
WALLACE: Gentlemen. . . Gentlemen. . .
DONALD TRUMP: He made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it.
WALLACE: Okay.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: What he did is he said. . .
WALLACE: Okay, we’re going to get into a new segment. Vice President, Vice President. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . .is he called the military stupid bastards.
JOE BIDEN: I did not say that.
DONALD TRUMP: He said it on tape. . . [crosstalk]
JOE BIDEN: Not true.
DONALD TRUMP: . . .He said “stupid bastards.”
WALLACE: Sir. [crosstalk] Stop.
JOE BIDEN: Play it.
DONALD TRUMP: I would never say that.
JOE BIDEN: Play it.
WALLACE: Go ahead.
DONALD TRUMP: You’re on tape.
WALLACE: Vice President answered his final question.
JOE BIDEN: The final question is, I can’t remember which of all his rantings was the final question.
WALLACE: [laughing] I’m having a little trouble myself, but…
JOE BIDEN: Yeah.
WALLACE: And about the economy and about this question of what it’s going to cost.
JOE BIDEN: The economy. . .
WALLACE: The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will do.
JOE BIDEN: The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants, we’re gonna build. . .
WALLACE: So, do you support the Green New Deal?
JOE BIDEN: Pardon me?
WALLACE: Do you support the . . .
JOE BIDEN: No, I don’t support the Green New Deal.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement.
JOE BIDEN: I support . . .
DONALD TRUMP: You just lost the radical left. It’s done. Oh you don’t?
JOE BIDEN: I support the Biden plan that I put forward.
WALLACE: Okay.
JOE BIDEN: The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls “The Radical Green New Deal.”
WALLACE: All right, gentlemen, final segment: Election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some ballots–mail-in ballots–after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election. In this final segment, Vice President, you go first.
JOE BIDEN: Prepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com. Decide how they’re going to vote, when they’re going to vote, and what means by which they’re going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida. Number one.
Number two, we’re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he’s trying to conf–to scare people into thinking that it’s not going to be legitimate.
Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you’re able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you’re able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you. Because you will—he cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not, when the votes are counted and they’re all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that’ll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he’s not sure what he’s going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn’t matter, because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. He’s gonna go. He can’t stay in power. It won’t happen. It won’t happen. So vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is gonna look like the next four years. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?
WALLACE: President, two minutes.
DONALD TRUMP: So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we’ve caught ’em. We’ve caught ’em all. We’ve got it all on tape. We’ve caught ’em all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office.
He knew about it too. So don’t tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it’s a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You’re soliciting. You’re asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited–they’re sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud. They found ’em in creeks. They found some, with the name Trump, just happened to have the name Trump, just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They’re being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen. The other thing, it’s nice. On November 3rd, you’re watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we’re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we’ve done.
But you know what? We won’t know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They’re not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They’re losing 30 and 40%. It’s a fraud, and it’s a shame. And can you imagine where they say, uh, “You have to have your ballot in by November 10th.” November 10th. That means, that’s seven days after the election, in theory, should’ve been announced.
WALLACE: Okay
DONALD TRUMP: We have major states with that. . .
WALLACE: Sir. Time. . .
DONALD TRUMP: … all run by Democrats-
WALLACE: Sir, two minutes is two minutes.
DONALD TRUMP: All run by Democrats.
WALLACE: President Trump. . . I, I,. . .
DONALD TRUMP: It’s a rigged election.
WALLACE: You’re going to be able to continue. You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it’s rigged, that it’s going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was a quarter, more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?
DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. I think I’m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I don’t think—I hope we don’t need them, in terms of the election itself. But for the ballots, I think so, because what’s happening is incredible. I just heard, I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take ’em. We don’t like ’em. We don’t like ’em. They throw ’em out. . .
WALLACE: But what are you going to do about it-
DONALD TRUMP: … left and right.
WALLACE: There are millions of ballots going out right now. What are you going to do. . .
DONALD TRUMP: What you do is you go and vote. You do a solicited ballot, and that’s okay. . .
WALLACE: No. No. I know your complaint. I’m asking you about the fact that millions of people have received. . .
DONALD TRUMP: You go and vote. You go and vote. . .
WALLACE: No. But what I’m saying is . . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . . like they used to in the old. . .
WALLACE: . . . what are you going to do about the fact that millions of people. . .
DONALD TRUMP: You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you’re sending it in, they’re sending it back and you’re sending. They have mailmen with lots of it. Did you see what’s going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. They’re being sold. They’re being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country.
JOE BIDEN: There is no–there is no evidence of that. . .
DONALD TRUMP: This is not going to end well.
JOE BIDEN: There is no evidence of that. . .
DONALD TRUMP: This is not going to end well.
WALLACE: Okay. Vice President Biden, in fact, go ahead, sir-
JOE BIDEN: Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don’t have to solicit the ballot. It’s sent to you. It’s sent to your home. What we’re saying is, they’re saying is that it has to be a postmark by the time, by election day. If it doesn’t get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He’s just afraid of counting the votes because. . . .
DONALD TRUMP: You’re wrong. You’re wrong. I love counting the votes. . .
JOE BIDEN: . . . he knows what the outcome will be.
WALLACE: I want to continue with you on this, Vice President Biden. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, he’s so wrong when he makes a statement like that-
WALLACE: No. Excuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity,. . .
DONALD TRUMP: That could be fraud.
WALLACE: . . .or they missed the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?
JOE BIDEN: I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here’s the deal. When you file—when you get a ballot and you fill it out, you’re supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn’t know, you have someone say that, this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you when, before the ballot is thrown out, that’s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct i. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it’s you. That is totally legitimate.
WALLACE: All right.
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, Chris, when you have eighty million ballots. . .
WALLACE: No. No. No. I have a final [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP:. . . sent in and swamping the system. . .
WALLACE: Gentlemen, I have a final question . . .
DONALD TRUMP: You know it can’t be done. You know it can’t, and already, there’s been fraud deception and . . .
JOE BIDEN: Mail service delivers 185 million pieces of mail a day. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . . Eighty million ballots.
WALLACE: We can keep talking. In eight states, election workers are prohibited, currently by law, eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day. That means that it’s likely, because there’s going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is, that it could be days. It could be weeks. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Could be months.
WALLACE: . . . until we find out who the new president is. So, I–first for you, sir. Finally, for the Vice-President, and I hope neither of you will interrupt the other. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump, you go first.
DONALD TRUMP: I’m urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They’re called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren’t allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging, I am urging my people. I hope it’s going to be a fair election. If it’s a fair election. . .
WALLACE: You’re urging them what?
DONALD TRUMP: . . . I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can’t go along with that. And I’ll tell you what. . .
WALLACE: What does that mean, not go along. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . .. from a common sense. . .
WALLACE: . . .does that mean you’re going to tell your people . . .
DONALD TRUMP: I’ll tell you what it means. . .
WALLACE: … to take to the streets?
DONALD TRUMP: It means you have a fraudulent election. You’re sending out 80 million ballots. . .
WALLACE: And what would you do about that?
DONALD TRUMP: They’re not equipped. These people aren’t equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. They were military. They all had the name Trump on them.
WALLACE: Vice President Biden-
DONALD TRUMP: You think that’s good?
WALLACE: Vice President Biden, final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?
JOE BIDEN: Yes. And here’s the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can’t even be opened until election day. And if there’s thousands of ballots, it’s going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military–they’ve been voting by ballots for since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that’s, and that’s what’s going to happen. Why was it not, why is it for them, somehow not fraudulent. It’s the same process. It’s honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that the, somehow it’s a fraudulent process.
DONALD TRUMP: It’s already been established. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney’s race. . .
WALLACE: I asked you. You had an opportunity to respond [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP: Look at Carolyn Maloney’s race. They have no idea what happened. . .
WALLACE: Go ahead. Vice President Biden, go ahead.
JOE BIDEN: He has no idea what he’s talking about. Here’s the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that’ll be the end of it. That’ll be the end of it. And if it’s me, in fact, fine. If it’s not me, I’ll support the outcome. And I’ll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I’ll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy if in fact. . .
DONALD TRUMP: I want to see an honest ballot count. . .
WALLACE: Gentlemen, just say that’s the end of it [crosstalk]. This is the end of this debate-
DONALD TRUMP: I want to see an honest ballot count.
WALLACE: We’re going to leave it there. . .
DONALD TRUMP: And I think he does too. . .
WALLACE: … to be continued in more debates as we go on. President Trump, Vice President Biden, it’s been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event. The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow, October 7th, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two Vice-Presidential nominees, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9:00 PM Eastern that night. We hope you watch. Until then, thank you, and good night.
