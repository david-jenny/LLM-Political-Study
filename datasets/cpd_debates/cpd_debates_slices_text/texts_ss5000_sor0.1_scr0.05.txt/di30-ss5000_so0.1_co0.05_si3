DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming.
JOE BIDEN: He blew it.
DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929.
WALLACE: Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-
DONALD TRUMP: When COVID came along.
WALLACE: … when there was record low unemployment before COVID.
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, Chris, wait.
JOE BIDEN: … number one. Number two-
DONALD TRUMP: Chris.
JOE BIDEN: Number three.
DONALD TRUMP: They said it would take… No, you’re on number two.
JOE BIDEN: No.
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, Chris. They said it would take-
JOE BIDEN: This guy-
DONALD TRUMP: … a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing.
JOE BIDEN: We did not. [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: … standard fare.
JOE BIDEN: I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry.
DONALD TRUMP: He totally gave up on manufacturing.
WALLACE: All right, let him-
JOE BIDEN: I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. We brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They’re gone. He blew it. And in fact, they’re gone-
DONALD TRUMP: Ohio had the best year it’s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you. [crosstalk].
WALLACE: Vice President, go ahead.
JOE BIDEN: And so you take a look at what he’s actually done. He’s done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China’s perfected the art of the steal. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit-
DONALD TRUMP: China ate your lunch- [crosstalk].
JOE BIDEN: … with Mexico.
DONALD TRUMP: China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and, wha–, he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we’re at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave your son three and a half million dollars?
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: What did he do to deserve it? What did he do with Burisma-
JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.
DONALD TRUMP: … to deserve $183,000?
WALLACE: Sir, you’ve asked him a question, let him answer it.
JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh really, he didn’t get three and a half million?
WALLACE: President-
JOE BIDEN: Is totally-
WALLACE: President, please. You’ve asked a question- [crosstalk]
JOE BIDEN: Totally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way-
DONALD TRUMP: Well wait, he didn’t get three and a half million dollars, Joe?
JOE BIDEN: Vice-
DONALD TRUMP: He got three and a half million dollars-
WALLACE: President.
DONALD TRUMP: … dollars.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really?
WALLACE: President, it’s an open discussion. Please- [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: It’s a fact.
JOE BIDEN: It is not a fact.
WALLACE: Well, you have raised an issue, let the Vice President answer.
JOE BIDEN: It’s been totally discredited.
DONALD TRUMP: Did Burisma pay him 183 thousand a month, with no experience in energy?
WALLACE: President-
JOE BIDEN: My son did nothing wrong at Burisma-
DONALD TRUMP: I think he did.
JOE BIDEN: The only guy that. . .
WALLACE: President, let him answer. [crosstalk].
JOE BIDEN: He doesn’t want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally thoroughly discredited. . .
DONALD TRUMP: By who?
JOE BIDEN: And you can-
DONALD TRUMP: The media.
JOE BIDEN: by everybody. Well, by the media, by our allies.
DONALD TRUMP: By the media, because they refuse to talk about it-
JOE BIDEN: By the World Bank-
DONALD TRUMP: … because they’re embarrassed.
JOE BIDEN: By everyone, as discredited. And matter of fact [crosstalk] Matter of fact-
WALLACE: President, please stop.
JOE BIDEN: Even the people who testified under oath-
DONALD TRUMP: So let me ask you this, Joe- [crosstalk].
WALLACE: No, no. Go ahead, – I’m listening to you.
JOE BIDEN: Even the people under-
DONALD TRUMP: He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow.
JOE BIDEN: … testified, he testified under oath in his Administration said I did my job and I did it very well.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really?
JOE BIDEN: I did it honorably.
DONALD TRUMP: I’d like to know who they are.
JOE BIDEN: Well, I’ll give you the list of the people who-
DONALD TRUMP: I’ll fire them.
WALLACE: No, no. Go ahead, sir.
JOE BIDEN: I’m sure that you’ve already fired most of them, because they did a good job.
DONALD TRUMP: Some people don’t do a good job.
JOE BIDEN: Well, here’s the- [crosstalk]
WALLACE: Go ahead. You get the- [crosstalk] Wait a minute. You get the final word, -
JOE BIDEN: Well, it’s hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me, this person.
DONALD TRUMP: Hey, hey, let me just say, that
JOE BIDEN: No, no. President- [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: Three and a half million, Joe.
JOE BIDEN: That is simply not true.
DONALD TRUMP: Why did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow?
JOE BIDEN: Look, here’s the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don’t want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family’s already-
DONALD TRUMP: My family-
WALLACE: No, no- [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP: My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with government.
JOE BIDEN: And that’s such a- [crosstalk]
WALLACE: President-
DONALD TRUMP: Every single one of them lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with government.
JOE BIDEN: This is not about my family or his family. It’s about your family, the American people. [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: And he got three and a half million dollars for nothing.
JOE BIDEN: That’s not true. It doesn’t want to talk about what you need. You, the American people. It’s about you. That’s what we’re talking about here. [crosstalk]
WALLACE: That’s the end of the segment. We’re moving on.
JOE BIDEN: He didn’t take that.
WALLACE: Vice President-
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, can I be honest? It’s a very important question-
JOE BIDEN: Try to be honest.
WALLACE: No.
DONALD TRUMP: He stood up-
WALLACE: The answer to the question is no.
DONALD TRUMP: … and he threatened Ukraine-
WALLACE: Sir-
DONALD TRUMP: … with a billion dollars-
JOE BIDEN: That is absolutely not true.
WALLACE: Stop. [crosstalk] Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I- [crosstalk] Why should I be different than the two of you? So here’s the deal.
JOE BIDEN: That’s a good point.
WALLACE: We have six segments. We have ended that segment. We’re going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments. In those two uninterrupted minutes, President, you can say anything you want. I’m going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But we, I, I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I’m appealing to you, sir, to do that.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, and him too.
WALLACE: Well, frankly, you’ve been doing more interrupting than he has.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, that’s all right, but he does plenty.
WALLACE: Well, sir, less than-
DONALD TRUMP: He does plenty.
WALLACE: No, less than you have. Let’s please continue on. The issue of race. Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh yeah, sure.
WALLACE: President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s true.
WALLACE: My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first.
JOE BIDEN: It’s about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It’s about the Constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require, acquire equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people. . . Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, spewing–just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed, and they asked the president what he thought. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that. [crosstalk].
WALLACE: It is his-
JOE BIDEN: Now-
WALLACE: … two minutes sir.
JOE BIDEN: … second point I’d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said “All he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all.” This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racist hatred, racist division.
This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn’t do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man, this man is a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man’s done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he’s talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community.
DONALD TRUMP: So-
WALLACE: President Trump, you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal with race issues?
DONALD TRUMP: You did a crime bill, 1994, where you called them super-predators. African-Americans are super-predators and they’ve never forgotten it. They’ve never forgotten it.
JOE BIDEN: I’ve never said-
WALLACE: No, no, sir. It’s his two minutes.
DONALD TRUMP: So you did that, and they call you super-predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990–and that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super-predators, and you’ve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned, and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200–250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.”
I don’t think you have any law enforcement. You can’t even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe? Why don’t you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If they called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won’t do it, because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don’t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order. And I’ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it.
WALLACE: All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, “Whether justice could be equally applied in America.” Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?
JOE BIDEN: Yes, there is. There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us. But there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I’m going to do as President of the United States is call a, a, together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we’re going to work this out.
We’re going to work this out. So we change the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don’t like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when–and by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.
WALLACE: All right, -
DONALD TRUMP: What is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town-
WALLACE: President Trump-
DONALD TRUMP: … and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- [crosstalk].
JOE BIDEN: That is not peaceful protest.
DONALD TRUMP: No it’s not, but you say it is.
JOE BIDEN: I did not say it is.
WALLACE: President Trump, I’d like to continue with the issue of race. I promise we’re going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment.
DONALD TRUMP: Fine.
WALLACE: This month, your Administration, uh, directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?
DONALD TRUMP: I ended it because it’s racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it, oh it’s totally racial. [crosstalk]
WALLACE: What is radical about racial sensitivity training?
DONALD TRUMP: If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we would pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And, and really, they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It’s a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to allow that to happen.
JOE BIDEN: Nobody’s doing that.
WALLACE: Vice President Biden.
JOE BIDEN: Nobody’s doing that. He’s the racist.
DONALD TRUMP: You just don’t know.
JOE BIDEN: Here’s the deal. I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP: You don’t know.
WALLACE: Let him finish.
JOE BIDEN: The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, uh, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It’s important that people know. Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings. But it’s amazing, it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a self-sense, a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and, and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, and grew up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They look down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re gonna bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on, and we can defeat racism in America.
WALLACE: Vice President… I mean, President Trump, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: During the Obama-Biden Administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at, uh, Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very…many places. Look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened a . . . Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now.
JOE BIDEN: Oh my Lord.
DONALD TRUMP: But the reason-
JOE BIDEN: This is ridiculous.
DONALD TRUMP: … is that the Democrats that run these cities-
JOE BIDEN: Absolutely ridiculous.
DONALD TRUMP: … don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order.
JOE BIDEN: Violent crime. . .
