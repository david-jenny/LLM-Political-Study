MICHAEL PENCE: Well, let me — let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult-driven campaign. It really is remarkable. At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration’s foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control. I mean, the situation we’re watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create. The newly emboldened — the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now their heavy-handed approach…
TIM KAINE: You guys love Russia. You both have said…
MICHAEL PENCE: … their heavy-handed approach.
TIM KAINE: You both have said — you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president.
MICHAEL PENCE: Well…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: Well, we’re going to get to Russia in just a moment. But I do want to get back to the question at…
MICHAEL PENCE: But in the midst — Elaine, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator, I’ll…
TIM KAINE: These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader. How can that…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: Yes, and we will get to that, Senator. We do have that coming up here. But in the meantime, the questions…
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, Senator, I must have hit a…[crosstalk]…I must have hit a nerve here.
QUIJANO: Why the disconnect?
MICHAEL PENCE: Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we’ve weakened America’s place in the world, stifled America’s economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults.
Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times. He’s brought an extraordinary business acumen. He’s employed tens of thousands of people in this country.
TIM KAINE: And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year.
[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: And why the disconnect with your running mate?
MICHAEL PENCE: But there’s a — there’s a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton. And that’s because they’re paying attention. I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on. She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments.
TIM KAINE: You are Donald Trump’s apprentice. Let me talk about this…[crosstalk]
MICHAEL PENCE: Senator, I think I’m still on my time.
TIM KAINE: Well, I think — isn’t this a discussion?
QUIJANO: This is our open discussion.
TIM KAINE: Yeah, let’s talk about the state of…[crosstalk]
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, let me interrupt — let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can.
TIM KAINE: Finish your sentence.
MICHAEL PENCE: The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state.
TIM KAINE: OK, now I can weigh in. Now…
MICHAEL PENCE: She had a private server…
TIM KAINE: Now, I get to weigh in. Now, let me just say this…
MICHAEL PENCE: … that was discovered…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: … Senator, you have an opportunity to respond.
MICHAEL PENCE: … keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public.
TIM KAINE: Governor Pence — Governor Pence doesn’t think the world’s going so well and he, you know, is going to say it’s everybody’s fault.
MICHAEL PENCE: Do you?
TIM KAINE: Let me tell you this. When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, do you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?
MICHAEL PENCE: Yes.
