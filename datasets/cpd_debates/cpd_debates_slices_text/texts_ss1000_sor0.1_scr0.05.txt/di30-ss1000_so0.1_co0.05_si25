JOE BIDEN: ... on his watch. And with regard to more divided, the nation, it can’t stay divided. We can’t be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being, and, and, and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got, he got the Bronze Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot and the people left behind, there, were heroes.
DONALD TRUMP: Really?
JOE BIDEN: And I resent-
DONALD TRUMP: Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter.
JOE BIDEN: I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden, you’re talking about Hunter?
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged. . .
JOE BIDEN: That’s not true he wasn’t dishonorably discharged.
DONALD TRUMP: . . .for cocaine use. And he didn’t have a job until you became Vice-President. Once you became Vice-President
JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.
DONALD TRUMP: . . . he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places.
JOE BIDEN: That is simply not true.
DONALD TRUMP: He made a fortune. . .
JOE BIDEN: My son. . . my son. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . . and he didn’t have a job.
JOE BIDEN: My son. . . like a lot of people. Like a lot of people we know at home had a drug problem. He’s overtaken it. He’s, he’s fixed it. He’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him. I’m proud of my son.
DONALD TRUMP: But why was he given tens of millions of dollars?
WALLACE: Alright. . .
JOE BIDEN: He wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars. [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: He was given tens of millions of dollars?
JOE BIDEN: That was totally discredited.
WALLACE: President Trump. President Trump. We’ve already been through this.
JOE BIDEN: Totally discredited.
WALLACE: We’ve bo. . .already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects.
JOE BIDEN: So do I.
DONALD TRUMP: [unintelligible]
WALLACE: Well, as the moderator, sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here.
DONALD TRUMP: I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true. That report is totally discredited.
DONALD TRUMP: Why did he get it?
JOE BIDEN: Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn’t worth taxpayer’s money. That report was written for political reason.
WALLACE: I’d like to talk about climate change.
JOE BIDEN: So would I.
WALLACE: Okay. The forest fires in the West are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change, President, you said, “I don’t think the science knows.” Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change, and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?
