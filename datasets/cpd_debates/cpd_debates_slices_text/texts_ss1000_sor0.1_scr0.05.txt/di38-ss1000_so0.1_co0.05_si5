QUIJANO: ... Times released part of Trump’s 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years. Yesterday, Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible. Does that seem fair to you?
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the “you’re hired,” “you’re fired” thing, Senator. You use that a whole lot. And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.
Look, what — what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government. And if you think that’s all working, then you look at the other side of the table. I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch. We’re in the…
TIM KAINE: Fifteen million new jobs?
MICHAEL PENCE: … slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.
TIM KAINE: Fifteen million new jobs?
QUIJANO: Governor…[crosstalk]
MICHAEL PENCE: There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side…
TIM KAINE: And the poverty level and the median income…
MICHAEL PENCE: … stepped into the Oval Office.
TIM KAINE: … improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015.
MICHAEL PENCE: You — honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different. People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different. I mean, this economy is struggling. The answer to this economy is not more taxes.
TIM KAINE: But it’s not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top.
MICHAEL PENCE: It’s not more spending…[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: I am interested to hear whether he’ll defend his running mate’s not releasing taxes and not paying taxes.
MICHAEL PENCE: Absolutely I will.
QUIJANO: Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine. And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine — God bless you for it, career public servants, that’s great — Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business.
Those tax returns that were — that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what’s called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.
TIM KAINE: But why won’t he release his tax returns?
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, we’re answering the question about — about a business thing, is he…
TIM KAINE: I do want to come back to that, but…
MICHAEL PENCE: His tax returns — his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it’s supposed to be used. And he did it brilliantly.
TIM KAINE: How do you know that? You haven’t seen his tax returns.
MICHAEL PENCE: He created a runway — because he’s created a business that’s worth billions of dollars today.
TIM KAINE: How do you know that?
MICHAEL PENCE: And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn’t pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs. And he’s paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes…
TIM KAINE: Elaine, let me talk about something.
QUIJANO: Senator, I’m going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you.
TIM KAINE: OK.
MICHAEL PENCE: The only issue on taxes — Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them.
