QUIJANO: Governor…
MICHAEL PENCE: That’s small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton…
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine?
MICHAEL PENCE: …. calling half of Donald Trump’s supporters a basket of deplorables.
TIM KAINE: Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn’t have said that.
MICHAEL PENCE: She said she shouldn’t have said half.
QUIJANO: Governor, this is Senator Kaine’s two minutes, please.
TIM KAINE: Yeah, that’s right, so now we’re even.
MICHAEL PENCE: Yeah. [laughter]
TIM KAINE: Look for Donald Trump apologizing to John McCain for saying he wasn’t a hero…
MICHAEL PENCE: Oh…
TIM KAINE: … to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting.
MICHAEL PENCE: She apologized for saying “half.”
QUIJANO: Governor. It is his two minutes, please.
TIM KAINE: Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight? Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell? Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States? You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing.
Immigration. There’s two plans on the table. Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform. Donald Trump believes in deportation nation. You’ve got to pick your choice. Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks.
That’s our proposal. Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship. So if you’re born here, but your parents don’t have documents, they want to eliminate that. That’s another 4.5 million people.
These guys — and Donald Trump has said it — deportation force. They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people. And I cannot believe…
MICHAEL PENCE: That’s nonsense. That’s nonsense.
TIM KAINE: I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate’s claim that we should create a deportation force to — so that they’ll all be gone.
MICHAEL PENCE: Senator, we have a deportation force. It’s called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America.
TIM KAINE: So you like the 16 million deportations?
MICHAEL PENCE: Senator, that’s — that’s nonsense. Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty. That’s…[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: Our plan is like Ronald Reagan’s plan from 1986.
MICHAEL PENCE: They call it comprehensive immigration reform — they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill. We all know the routine. It’s amnesty. And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security.
That’s how Washington always plays it.
TIM KAINE: No, I…
MICHAEL PENCE: They always say we’re going to do this, we’re going to do that, we’ll eventually get the border…[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: … border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it.
QUIJANO: Governor, Trump has said…
MICHAEL PENCE: Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation. Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws.
QUIJANO: So, Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave? Would they be forcibly removed?
