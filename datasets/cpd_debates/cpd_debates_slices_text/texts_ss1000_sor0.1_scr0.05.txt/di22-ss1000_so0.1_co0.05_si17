MITT ROMNEY: ... not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation. Instead let people make their own choice. And if they — if they find that — that they can’t get the benefits here that they want and they can’t — and they can’t find the job they want, then they’ll make a decision to go a place where — where they have better opportunities.
But I’m not in favor of rounding up people and — and — and taking them out of this country. I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country.
MITT ROMNEY: Let me mention something else the president said. It was a moment ago and I didn’t get a chance to, when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth.
BARACK OBAMA: Candy?
Hold on a second. The…
MITT ROMNEY: President, I’m still speaking.
(CROSSTALK)
MITT ROMNEY: President, let me finish.
(CROSSTALK)
MITT ROMNEY: I’ve gotta continue.
(CROSSTALK)
CROWLEY: Governor Romney, you can make it short. See all these people? They’ve been waiting for you. (inaudible) make it short (inaudible).
MITT ROMNEY: Just going to make a point. Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust. And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in — in Chinese companies.
 President, have you looked at your pension? Have you looked at your pension?
BARACK OBAMA: I’ve got to say…
MITT ROMNEY: President, have you looked at your pension?
BARACK OBAMA: You know, I — I don’t look at my pension. It’s not as big as yours so it doesn’t take as long.
MITT ROMNEY: Well, let me give you some advice.
BARACK OBAMA: I don’t check it that often.
MITT ROMNEY: Let me give you some advice. Look at your pension. You also have investments in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments through a Cayman’s trust.
(CROSSTALK)
CROWLEY: We’re way off topic here, Governor Romney.
(CROSSTALK)
BARACK OBAMA: I thought we were talking about immigration.
(CROSSTALK)
BARACK OBAMA: I do want to make sure that…
CROWLEY: If I could have you sit down, Governor Romney. Thank you.
BARACK OBAMA: I do want to make sure that — I do want to make sure that we just understand something. Governor Romney says he wasn’t referring to Arizona as a model for the nation. His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing. That’s his policy. And it’s a bad policy. And it won’t help us grow.
Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise. And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google. And we want to encourage that.
Now, we’ve got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better. But when we make this into a divisive political issue, and when we don’t have bipartisan support — I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we can’t…
MITT ROMNEY: I’ll get it done. I’ll get it done. First year…
BARACK OBAMA: … we can’t — we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all. And it’s time for them to get serious on it.
CROWLEY: President, let me move you on here please. President, (inaudible).
BARACK OBAMA: This used to be a bipartisan issue.
(CROSSTALK)
CROWLEY: Don’t go away, though — right. Don’t go away because I — I want you to talk to Kerry Ladka who wants to switch the topic for us.
BARACK OBAMA: OK.
Hi, Kerry.
AUDIENCE QUESTION: Good evening, President.
BARACK OBAMA: I’m sorry. What’s your name?
AUDIENCE QUESTION: It’s Kerry, Kerry Ladka.
