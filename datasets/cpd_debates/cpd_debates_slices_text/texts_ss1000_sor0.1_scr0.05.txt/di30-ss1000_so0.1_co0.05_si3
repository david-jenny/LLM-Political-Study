WALLACE: President.
DONALD TRUMP: I got rid of it. And we will protect people.
WALLACE: President, I’m the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.
DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.
WALLACE: You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?
DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay. I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There’s nothing symbolic. I’m cutting drug prices. I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47-year period in government, but you didn’t do it. Nobody’s done it. So we’re cutting healthcare.
WALLACE: What about pre-existing conditions?
DONALD TRUMP: All of the things that we’ve done.
JOE BIDEN: He has not done healthcare.
DONALD TRUMP: I’ll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing. Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do.
WALLACE: Okay, like I say, this is open discussion.
DONALD TRUMP: This is big stuff.
WALLACE: Sir, you’ll be happy. I’m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare.
JOE BIDEN: Yes.
WALLACE: And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.
JOE BIDEN: It is not.
WALLACE: If I start asking the question.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s not what your party says, by the way.
WALLACE: And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of healthcare.
JOE BIDEN: It does not. It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two.
DONALD TRUMP: Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine.
JOE BIDEN: Look, hey.
DONALD TRUMP: Are you saying you didn’t agree?
JOE BIDEN: I’m not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.
DONALD TRUMP: Not by much.
JOE BIDEN: I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.
DONALD TRUMP: Not by much.
JOE BIDEN: I’m here standing facing you, old buddy.
DONALD TRUMP: If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.
JOE BIDEN: All he knows how to do-
DONALD TRUMP: On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky.
JOE BIDEN: Look he’s the deal. I got very lucky. I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well.
DONALD TRUMP: With what?
JOE BIDEN: And tonight I’m going to make sure.
DONALD TRUMP: With what?
