WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it’s an open discussion.
HILLARY CLINTON: He says…[crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: We would have gained if they did it by surprise.
WALLACE: Secretary, please let Trump speak.
HILLARY CLINTON: … unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.
DONALD TRUMP: No, you are the one that’s unfit. You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out—John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right. He said some beauties. And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment. You do.
And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we’re going in, and all of the people that we really wanted—the leaders—they’re all gone. If you think that was good, then you do. Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment. I agree with both.
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he’s supporting for president. And he has said…
DONALD TRUMP: Which is a big mistake.
HILLARY CLINTON: … as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America. I think he’s right.
WALLACE: Let’s turn to Aleppo. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo. And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir. You said that Aleppo has basically fallen. In fact, there—in fact, there are…
DONALD TRUMP: It’s a catastrophe. I mean…
WALLACE: It’s a catastrophe, but there…
DONALD TRUMP: … it’s a mess.
WALLACE: There are a quarter of…
DONALD TRUMP: Have you seen it? Have you seen it?
WALLACE: Sir…
DONALD TRUMP: Have you seen what’s happened to Aleppo?
WALLACE: Sir, if I may finish my question…
DONALD TRUMP: OK, so it hasn’t fallen. Take a look at it.
WALLACE: Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s right. And they are being slaughtered…
WALLACE: Yes.
DONALD TRUMP: … because of bad decisions.
WALLACE: If I may just finish here, and you also said that—that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS. In fact, they have been the ones who’ve been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo. Would you like to clear that up, sir?
DONALD TRUMP: Well, Aleppo is a disaster. It’s a humanitarian nightmare. But it has fallen from the—from any standpoint. I mean, what do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what’s happened.
And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what’s happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she’s going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she’s—he’s just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He—he aligned with Russia.
He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We give them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean, cash. Bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion.
Now they have—he has aligned with Russia and with Iran. They don’t want ISIS, but they have other things, because we’re backing—we’re backing rebels. We don’t know who the rebels are. We’re giving them lots of money, lots of everything. We don’t know who the rebels are. And when and if—and it’s not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now. But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with—as bad as Assad is, and he’s a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.
If she did nothing, we’d be in much ...
