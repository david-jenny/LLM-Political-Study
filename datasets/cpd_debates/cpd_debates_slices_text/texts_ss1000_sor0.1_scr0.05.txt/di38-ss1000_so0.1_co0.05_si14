MICHAEL PENCE: ... was secured in 2009.
But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war. The president just ordered more troops on the ground. We are back at war in Iraq. And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I’d always give her a hug and tell her we’re never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow.
And a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran.
TIM KAINE: Stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot?
MICHAEL PENCE: You didn’t stop the nuclear weapons program.
TIM KAINE: Yes, we did.
MICHAEL PENCE: You essentially…
TIM KAINE: Even the Israeli military says it stopped.
MICHAEL PENCE: … guaranteed that Iran will someday become a nuclear power, because there’s no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off.
QUIJANO: Governor Pence, Trump has proposed extreme vetting of immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism. But that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the Orlando nightclub massacre and the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey. Those were homegrown, committed by U.S. citizens and legal residents. What specific tools would you use to prevent those kinds of attacks?
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, I think it’s — I think it’s a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first.
I mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don’t bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life.
But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500…[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: Elaine, I want to…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: Governor, the question was about homegrown.
MICHAEL PENCE: Yeah, and so — but first, you know, let’s make sure we’re putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program…
TIM KAINE: Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they’re dangerous.
MICHAEL PENCE: That’s not — that’s absolutely false.
TIM KAINE: That’s what the Seventh Circuit decided just — here’s the difference, Elaine.
MICHAEL PENCE: The Seventh Circuit…
TIM KAINE: We have different views on — on refugee issues and on immigration. Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous? These guys say all Mexicans are bad.
MICHAEL PENCE: That’s absolutely false.
TIM KAINE: And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they’re dangerous. Donald Trump said keep them out if they’re Muslim. Mike Pence…
MICHAEL PENCE: Absolutely…
TIM KAINE: … put a program in place to keep them out if they’re from Syria. And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan…
MICHAEL PENCE: Right. Right.
TIM KAINE: … and said it was discriminatory…
MICHAEL PENCE: And those judges — those judges said…
TIM KAINE: We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination.
QUIJANO: Governor?
MICHAEL PENCE: Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn’t any evidence yet that — that ISIS had infiltrated the United States. Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS.
[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: But they told you there’s a right way and a wrong way to do it.
