MICHAEL PENCE: Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won. And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence…
TIM KAINE: But can you defend Donald Trump’s claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons?
MICHAEL PENCE: … and assurance to our allies. But let me go back to this Iran thing. I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented — that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: That’s what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now.
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, that’s not what — that’s not what Israel thinks.
TIM KAINE: Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it.
MICHAEL PENCE: You wouldn’t necessarily know that.
TIM KAINE: Go to the tape.
MICHAEL PENCE: I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu’s speech when he came before the Congress.
TIM KAINE: No, I visited him in his office. I visited him in his office.
MICHAEL PENCE: You boycotted the speech. The point is, what this Iran — so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee — I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it — literally in the history of the United States, against Iran.
TIM KAINE: And then Hillary used them to get a deal.
MICHAEL PENCE: We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions.
TIM KAINE: Elaine, let me just mention one thing.
[crosstalk]
MICHAEL PENCE: They have not — Elaine, let me finish a sentence. They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions. And when the deal’s period runs out, there’s no limitation on them obtaining weapons. That…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: And very quickly, Senator.
TIM KAINE: Elaine…
MICHAEL PENCE: … and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment…
QUIJANO: We need to talk about Russia. Very quickly, though, Senator, please.
MICHAEL PENCE: … is astonishing to the American people.
TIM KAINE: Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can’t imagine how you can defend your running mate’s position on one issue after the next. And in all six cases, he’s refused to defend his running mate.
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, let’s — no, no, don’t put words in my mouth.
QUIJANO: All right.
MICHAEL PENCE: He’s going…[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend. And I just think that should be underlined.
MICHAEL PENCE: No, I’m — look…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: All right, gentlemen, let’s talk about Russia. This is a topic that has come up.
MICHAEL PENCE: I’m very, very happy to defend Donald Trump. If he wants to take these one at a time, I’ll take them one at a time.
QUIJANO: I will give you an opportunity to do that.
TIM KAINE: More nations should get nuclear weapons. Try to defend that.
MICHAEL PENCE: Don’t put words in my mouth. Well, he never said that, Senator.
TIM KAINE: He absolutely said it. Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan.
MICHAEL PENCE: Most of the stuff you’ve said, he’s never said.
QUIJANO: Gentlemen, Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime. What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions? Senator Kaine?
TIM KAINE: You’ve got to be tough on Russia. So let’s start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader. Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he’s a great leader. And Donald Trump has business…
MICHAEL PENCE: No, we haven’t.
