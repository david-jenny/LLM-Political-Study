WALLACE: Now, gentleman. I think I’m going to take back the moderator’s role. . .
DONALD TRUMP: There aren’t any. I don’t think there are any.
WALLACE: . . . and I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent. In Portland, Oregon, especially we had a, more than a hundred straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Vice-President you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have, though, is as the Democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, “Hey, you gotta stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you’d stop the days and months of violence in Portland.”
JOE BIDEN: I don’t hold public office, now. I am a former Vice-President. I’ve made it clear. I’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted, and anyone who commits it should be prosecuted.
WALLACE: But you’ve never called for the people…
DONALD TRUMP: He’s never done that.
WALLACE: Excuse me, sir. You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call and bring in the National Guard and knock off a 100 days of riots.
JOE BIDEN: They can in fact take care of it if he’d just stay out of the way.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh really? Oh really?
WALLACE: Let, let’s just. . .
DONALD TRUMP: I sent in the US Marshals. . .
JOE BIDEN: Here, here’s the thing. . .
WALLACE: I asked a question. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . .to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street, they shot him. For three days Portland didn’t do anything.
WALLACE: President Trump. President Trump. President Trump. . . I interrupted. President Trump.
DONALD TRUMP: I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business.
WALLACE: Go ahead sir.
JOE BIDEN: And by the way his own former spokesperson said, you know, “Riots and chaos and violence help his cause.” That’s what this is all about.
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t know who said that.
JOE BIDEN: I do.
DONALD TRUMP: Who?
JOE BIDEN: I think it–Kellyanne Conway.
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t think she said that.
JOE BIDEN: She said that.
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t think so.
JOE BIDEN: And so here, here’s the point. The point is that, that’s what he is keep trying to rile everything up. He doesn’t want to calm things down. Instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire. Constantly. At every single solitary time.
WALLACE: Okay. And, and, and to end this, button up this segment, I’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly…
DONALD TRUMP: You mean, I have to answer his stuff?
WALLACE: You have repeatedly…
DONALD TRUMP: His statement?
WALLACE: You have repeatedly. . . No. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Wait a second, you made a statement.
WALLACE: No, you’ve been talking back and forth. I’m asking you.
DONALD TRUMP: I would love to end it. I would love to end it.
WALLACE: I would love to know sir. . . You know sir if you want to switch seats
DONALD TRUMP: . . . we could, very quickly
WALLACE: . . . we can do that.
