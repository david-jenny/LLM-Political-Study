DANFORTH QUAYLE: ... Wouldn’t that be nice to take $20.7 billion that we’re putting into our legal system and put it to preventive health care or women’s health care or something else besides trial lawyers?
But no — you don’t want to reform the health care system to drive down costs through medical malpractice. What you’re doing — you are talking about a government program. Your program is to ration health care. You said in your statement to see a doctor when you want to see a doctor. When you start rationing health care there’s going to be a waiting line to see a doctor unless it’s an emergency.
Remember when we rationed energy in this country? Waiting lines at the gasoline stations. The same thing would happen when you ration health care. The president’s proposal deals with tax credits, deductions and purchasing health care in the private sector and making health care affordable and available to every single American.
BRUNO: Admiral Stockdale, would you like to start the discussion period?
STOCKDALE: Well, I’m out of ammunition on this —
ALBERT GORE: Well, let me talk then because I’ve got a couple of things that I want to say.
BRUNO: Go ahead, Senator.
ALBERT GORE: We still didn’t get an answer to the question of why George Bush waited for 3 and a half years —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: He didn’t wait 3 and a half years.
ALBERT GORE: — during the national —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: I did answer the question.
ALBERT GORE: — health insurance crisis before he even made a proposal. And it still hasn’t been submitted to Congress in the form of legislation. I also want to respond to the question about malpractice. Do you know which state has the lowest malpractice premiums in the entire country? Bill Clinton’s Arkansas does — partly because he has passed reform measures limiting the time during which malpractice suits can be filed. In fact, tort claims generally have fallen 10 % under Bill Clinton there.
But you know, that’s not the reason for this health insurance crisis. The reason is, we’ve had absolutely no leadership. Let me tell you about a friend of mine named Mitch Philpot from Marietta, Georgia — not far from here — who Tipper and I met with his family in Johns Hopkins Hospital. Their son, Brett, was in the bed next to our son and they couldn’t pay their medical bills. They used to live in Atlanta, but they lost their house. And while they were there, both Mitch and his wife lost their jobs because they could not get unpaid leave.
We pass legislation to give family leave under circumstances like that, exempting small business. How can you talk about family values, Dan, and twice veto the Family Medical Leave Act?
(APPLAUSE)
BRUNO: Mr Vice President.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Pass our Family Leave Act, because it goes to small businesses where the major problem is. Your proposal excluded small business. That’s the problem.
Now, let me talk about health care and —
ALBERT GORE: Did you require it? Did you require it?
DANFORTH QUAYLE: My turn — (holding hand up at Gore)
ALBERT GORE: Did you require (inaudible) —
(Simultaneous conversation)
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Lightenâ€™ up Al. My turn.
ALBERT GORE: It’s a free discussion.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Take a breath, Al. Inhale.
ALBERT GORE: It’s a free discussion.
(APPLAUSE)
Did you require family leave in that legislation? Yes or no?
DANFORTH QUAYLE: We offered incentives to small businesses. Yes or no —
ALBERT GORE: That’s a no, isn’t it?
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Was small business exempted under your proposal?
ALBERT GORE: Yes.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Yes. And that’s where the biggest problem is —
ALBERT GORE: Did you require it of anyone?
DANFORTH QUAYLE: I’m going to get back to the topic again —
ALBERT GORE: Did you require it of anyone?
DANFORTH QUAYLE: — because he obviously doesn’t want to talk about health insurance or health care, which you address. I was absolutely — I shouldn’t say that — another Clinton. You pulled another Clinton on me because here you go again. Medical malpractice legislation has been before the ...
