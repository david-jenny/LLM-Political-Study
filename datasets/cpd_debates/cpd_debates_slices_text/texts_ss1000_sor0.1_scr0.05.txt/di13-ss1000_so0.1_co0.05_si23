IFILL: You have 30 seconds to respond to that, Vice President.
RICHARD CHENEY: Well, Gwen — I’m sorry, it’s hard to know where to start.
The fact of the matter is, the most important and significant change in health care in the last several years was the Medicare reform bill this year. It’s the most sweeping change in 40 years.
Medicare used to pay for heart bypass surgery but didn’t pay for the prescription drugs that might allow you to avoid it.
The fact is that when that came up, Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards voted against it. It’ll provide prescription drug benefits to 40 million senior citizens. It’s a very, very significant piece of legislation.
IFILL: Thirty seconds.
JOHN EDWARDS: They had a choice on allowing prescription drugs into this country from Canada, of being with the American people or with the drug companies. They were with the drug companies.
They had a choice on negotiating discounts in the Medicare prescription drug bill of being with the American people or with the drug companies. They were with the drug companies.
They had a choice on the patients’ bill of rights, allowing people to make their own health care decisions and not having insurance companies make them, be with the American people, be with the big insurance companies.
They’re with the insurance companies.
John Kerry and I will always fight for the American people.
IFILL: As previously agreed, we’ll go to closing statements now, two minutes each.
Coin toss, Senator Edwards, you begin.
JOHN EDWARDS: Thank you.
Thank you, Gwen.
Thank you, Vice President, for being here.
You know, when I was young and growing up, I remember coming down the steps into the kitchen, early in the morning, and I would see the glow of the television.
And I’d see my father sitting at a table. He wasn’t paying bills, and he wasn’t doing paperwork from work.
What he was doing was learning math on television.
Now, he didn’t have a college education, but he was doing what he could do to get a better job in the mill where he worked. I was proud of him. I’m still proud of him.
And I was also hopeful, because I knew that I lived in a country where I could get a college education.
Here’s the truth: I have grown up in the bright light of America. But that light is flickering today.
Now, I know that the vice president and the president don’t see it, but you do.
You see it when your incomes are going down and the cost of everything — college tuition, health care — is going through the roof. You see it when you sit at your table each night and there’s an empty chair because a loved one is serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. What they’re going to give you is four more years of the same.
John Kerry and I believe that we can do better. We believe in a strong middle-class in this country. That’s why we have a plan to create jobs, getting rid of tax cuts for companies outsourcing your jobs; give tax cuts to companies that’ll keep jobs here in America.
That’s why we have a health care plan. That’s why we have a plan to keep you safe and to fix this mess in Iraq.
The truth is that every four years you get to decide. You have the ability to decide where America’s going to go. John Kerry and I are asking you to give us the power to fight for you, to fight to keep that dream in America, that I saw as a young man, alive for every parent sitting at that kitchen table.
IFILL: Vice President Cheney?
RICHARD CHENEY: Gwen, I want to thank you.
It’s been a privilege to serve as your vice president these last four years and to work alongside President Bush to put our economy on an upward path.
We’ve cut taxes, added 1.7 million new jobs in the last year, and we’ll continue to provide opportunities for business and for workers.
We won’t be happy until every American who wants to work can find a job.
We believe that all Americans ought to have access to available — to medical care and that they ought to have access to the finest schools in the world.
We’ll do everything we can to preserve Social Security and to make certain that it’s there for future generations.
I’ve worked for four presidents and watched two others up close, and I know that there’s no such thing as a routine day in the Oval Office.
We saw on 9/11 that the next president — next decision a president has to make can affect the lives of all of ...
