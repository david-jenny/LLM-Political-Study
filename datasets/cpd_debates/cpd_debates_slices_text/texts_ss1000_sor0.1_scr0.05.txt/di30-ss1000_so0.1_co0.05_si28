JOE BIDEN: Not true.
DONALD TRUMP: You know, that’s not true either, right?
JOE BIDEN: Not true.
DONALD TRUMP: This is, this is a 100 trillion. . .
JOE BIDEN: Simply. . . Look-
DONALD TRUMP: That’s more money than our country could make in a hundred years if it were. . .
JOE BIDEN: That is simply not the case. . .
DONALD TRUMP: It would destroy our country.
WALLACE: All right. Let me. Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, some, the president is saying, I think, some people who support the president would say, that sounds like it’s going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy.
JOE BIDEN: What it’s going to do, it’s going to create thousands and millions of jobs. Good paying jobs.
DONALD TRUMP: Hundred trillion dollars.
WALLACE: Let him finish, sir.
JOE BIDEN: He doesn’t know how to do that.
DONALD TRUMP: 100 trillion dollars.
JOE BIDEN: The fact is, it’s going to create millions of good-paying jobs. And these tax incentives to people, for people to weatherize, which he wants to get, get rid of. It’s going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we’re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, with, deal with. . . By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may go away.
DONALD TRUMP: I never said that at all.
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, you did say that.
DONALD TRUMP: They made it up.
JOE BIDEN: And here’s the deal. . .
DONALD TRUMP: You make up a lot.
JOE BIDEN: . . . we’re going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. We’re in real trouble. Look what’s happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn’t happen before. They’re because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world’s problem. We in fact, but the rest of the world, we’ve got to get them to come along. That’s why we have to get back into, back into the Paris Accord.
WALLACE: All right, gentlemen. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute, Chris. So why didn’t he do it for 47 years? You were Vice-President?
JOE BIDEN: For 47?
DONALD TRUMP: So why didn’t you get the world—China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars. . .
JOE BIDEN: That is not my plan.
DONALD TRUMP: . . .not 20 billion. . . .
JOE BIDEN: The Green New Deal is not my plan. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . . You want to rebuild every building.
JOE BIDEN: . . . If you knew anything about. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Well, you want to rebuild everything
JOE BIDEN: If he knew anything about. . .
WALLACE: Gentlemen. . . Gentlemen. . .
DONALD TRUMP: He made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it.
WALLACE: Okay.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: What he did is he said. . .
