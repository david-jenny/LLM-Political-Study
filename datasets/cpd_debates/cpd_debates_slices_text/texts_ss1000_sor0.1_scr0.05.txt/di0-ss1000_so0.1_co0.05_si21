BARACK OBAMA: ... of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.
And we believe China can be a partner, but we’re also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there. We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues. And we’re organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.
That’s the kind of leadership we’ve shown in the region. That’s the kind of leadership that we’ll continue to show.
MITT ROMNEY: I just want to take one of those points, again, attacking me as not talking about an agenda for — for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country. But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere. Nothing could be further from the truth.
I’m a son of Detroit. I was born in Detroit. My dad was head of a car company. I like American cars. And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry. My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks. It was President Bush that wrote the first checks. I disagree with that. I said they need — these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy. And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they’d — they’d built up.
And fortunately…
(CROSSTALK)
BARACK OBAMA: Governor Romney, that’s not what you said…
(CROSSTALK)
BARACK OBAMA: Governor Romney, you did not…
MITT ROMNEY: You can take a look at the op-ed…
(CROSSTALK)
BARACK OBAMA: You did not say that you would provide government help.
MITT ROMNEY: I said that we would provide guarantees, and — and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy. Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet. And the idea that has been suggested that I would liquidate the industry, of course not. Of course not.
(CROSSTALK)
BARACK OBAMA: Let’s check the record.
(CROSSTALK)
MITT ROMNEY: That’s the height of silliness…
(CROSSTALK)
BARACK OBAMA: Let — let — let’s…
(CROSSTALK)
MITT ROMNEY: I have never said I would liquidate…
(CROSSTALK)
BARACK OBAMA: …at the record.
(CROSSTALK)
MITT ROMNEY: …I would liquidate the industry.
(CROSSTALK)
BARACK OBAMA: Governor, the people in Detroit don’t forget.
(CROSSTALK)
MITT ROMNEY: …and — and that’s why I have the kind of commitment to ensure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful. We in this country can — can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we’re going to. We’re going to have to have a president, however, that doesn’t think that somehow the government investing in — in car companies like Tesla and — and Fisker, making electric battery cars. This is not research, Mr President, these are the government investing in companies. Investing in Solyndra. This is a company, this isn’t basic research. I — I want to invest in research. Research is great. Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great. But investing in companies? Absolutely not.
(CROSSTALK)
BARACK OBAMA: Governor?
MITT ROMNEY: That’s the wrong way to go.
(CROSSTALK)
BARACK OBAMA: The fact of the matter is…
(CROSSTALK)
MITT ROMNEY: I’m still speaking. So I want to make sure that we make — we make America more competitive.
BARACK OBAMA: Yeah.
MITT ROMNEY: And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow. But you’re investing in companies doesn’t do that. In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here…
BARACK OBAMA: Governor?
MITT ROMNEY: …because the private sector’s not going to invest in a…
