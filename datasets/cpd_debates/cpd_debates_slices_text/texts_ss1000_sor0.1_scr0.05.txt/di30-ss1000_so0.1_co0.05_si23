DONALD TRUMP: I would love to end it. I would love to end it.
WALLACE: I would love to know sir. . . You know sir if you want to switch seats
DONALD TRUMP: . . . we could, very quickly
WALLACE: . . . we can do that.
DONALD TRUMP: I’ll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That’d be no problem. But they don’t want to accept the National Guard.
WALLACE: You have repeatedly criticized the Vice-President for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left-wing extremist groups. But are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland.
DONALD TRUMP: Sure, I’m willing to do that.
WALLACE: Are you prepared specifically to do it. Well go ahead, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: I would say almost everything I see is from the left-wing not from the right wing.
WALLACE: So what are you, what are you saying?
DONALD TRUMP: I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.
WALLACE: Well, do it, sir.
JOE BIDEN: Say it. Do it. Say it.
DONALD TRUMP: You want to call them? What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who would you like me to condemn.
WALLACE: White supremacists and racists.
JOE BIDEN: Proud Boys.
WALLACE: White supremacists and white militias.
JOE BIDEN: Proud Boys.
DONALD TRUMP: Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you what: somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left-wing. This is a left-wing problem. . .
JOE BIDEN: He’s own FBI Director said unlike white supremacists. . .
DONALD TRUMP: This is a left-wing problem.
JOE BIDEN: Antifa is an idea not an organization. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Oh you gotta be kidding.
JOE BIDEN: … not a militia. That’s what his FBI Director said.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, then you know what, he’s wrong.
WALLACE: Gentlemen, gentlemen. No, no, no, we’re done, sir. Moving onto the next… [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: . . . when a bat hits you over the head, that’s not an idea. Antifa is bad.
JOE BIDEN: Everybody in your Administration. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Antifa is bad.
JOE BIDEN: Everybody in your Administration tells you the truth, has a bad idea. You have no idea . . . .
DONALD TRUMP: You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group.
WALLACE: All right, gentlemen we’re now moving onto the Trump and Biden records.
DONALD TRUMP: And you ought to be careful of them, they’ll overthrow you.
WALLACE: I’m going to ask a question. When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but Vice-President Biden, you like to quote one of your dad’s sayings, which is don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I’m going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent? In this segment, President Trump you’ll go first, two minutes.
DONALD TRUMP: Because there has never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you saw what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had to fight, both flanks and behind me and above, there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done.
