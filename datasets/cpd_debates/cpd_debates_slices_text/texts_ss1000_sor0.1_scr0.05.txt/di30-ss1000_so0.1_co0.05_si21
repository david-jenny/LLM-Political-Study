DONALD TRUMP: ... people were shot and eight died. Shot. If you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100, 150, 200 percent, uh, crime, it is crazy what’s going on . . .
JOE BIDEN: Republican cities, republican cities.
DONALD TRUMP: . . . and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with. But if he ever got to run this country, and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have. . .
JOE BIDEN: By the way. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . . our suburbs would be gone. By the way, our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before.
JOE BIDEN: He wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn. He was, he was. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I know suburbs so much better than you.
WALLACE: Gentlemen wait a minute.
JOE BIDEN: I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There’s as many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past. What’s, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They’re dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That’s why the suburbs are in trouble.
WALLACE: I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support?
JOE BIDEN: It means. . .
WALLACE: . . . If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call uh, for uh, community control of policing?
JOE BIDEN: Look, what I support is the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding, in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before, where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up. It went down. And so we have to be engaged with . . .
DONALD TRUMP: That’s not what they are talking about, Chris. That’s not what it . . . He’s talking about defunding the police.
JOE BIDEN: That’s exactly. . . that is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: He doesn’t have any law support. He has no law enforcement support.
DONALD TRUMP: Almost nothing.
JOE BIDEN: That’s not true. That’s not. . . Oh, look. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really, who do you have? Name one group that supports you. Name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think. We have time.
JOE BIDEN: We don’t have time to do anything except . . .
DONALD TRUMP: No, no. Think about it. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you.
JOE BIDEN: Folks, folks. . .
WALLACE: Now, gentleman. I think I’m going to take back the moderator’s role. . .
DONALD TRUMP: There aren’t any. I don’t think there are any.
