BARACK OBAMA: Candy, there’s no doubt that world demand’s gone up, but our production is going up, and we’re using oil more efficiently. And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true. We’ve opened up public lands. We’re actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my — the previous president was an oil man.
And natural gas isn’t just appearing magically. We’re encouraging it and working with the industry.
And when I hear Governor Romney say he’s a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when — Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, “This plant kills,” and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly you’re a big champion of coal.
So what I’ve tried to do is be consistent. With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we’re producing more coal, we’re producing it cleaner and smarter. Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas.
And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years. Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we’re also starting to build cars that are more efficient.
And that’s creating jobs. That means those cars can be exported, ’cause that’s the demand around the world, and it also means that it’ll save money in your pocketbook.
BARACK OBAMA: That’s the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that’s what we’re going to do in the next four years.
MITT ROMNEY: But that’s not what you’ve done in the last four years. That’s the problem. In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.
BARACK OBAMA: Not true, Governor Romney.
MITT ROMNEY: So how much did you cut (inaudible)?
BARACK OBAMA: Not true.
MITT ROMNEY: How much did you cut them by, then?
BARACK OBAMA: Governor, we have actually produced more oil —
MITT ROMNEY: No, no. How much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?
BARACK OBAMA: Governor Romney, here’s what we did. There were a whole bunch of oil companies.
(CROSSTALK)
MITT ROMNEY: No, no, I had a question and the question was how much did you cut them by?
BARACK OBAMA: You want me to answer a question —
MITT ROMNEY: How much did you cut them by?
BARACK OBAMA: I’m happy to answer the question.
MITT ROMNEY: All right. And it is —
BARACK OBAMA: Here’s what happened. You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren’t using. So what we said was you can’t just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it’s most profitable for you. These are public lands. So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.
MITT ROMNEY: OK, (inaudible) —
BARACK OBAMA: And so what we did was take away those leases. And we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.
MITT ROMNEY: And production on private — on government land —
BARACK OBAMA: Production is up.
MITT ROMNEY: — is down.
BARACK OBAMA: No, it isn’t.
MITT ROMNEY: Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent.
BARACK OBAMA: Governor —
MITT ROMNEY: And production on gas —
(CROSSTALK)
BARACK OBAMA: It’s just not true.
MITT ROMNEY: It’s absolutely true. Look, there’s no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal lands and in federal waters. And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up.
I was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs. The right course for America is to ...
