WALLACE: Okay. Gentlemen?
DONALD TRUMP: Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts.
WALLACE: President, we’re talking about the economy. I’d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Vice President, your economic plan-
DONALD TRUMP: He has none.
WALLACE: … if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year.
WALLACE: … and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it’s just coming out of a recession.
JOE BIDEN: Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-
WALLACE: But respectfully, sir, I’m talking about taxes, not spending.
JOE BIDEN: By the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn’t be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.
DONALD TRUMP: Why didn’t you do it before, when you were Vice-President with Obama?
JOE BIDEN: Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal.
DONALD TRUMP: I got it done. And you know what happened?
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, you got it done-
DONALD TRUMP: Our economy boomed like it’s never boomed before.
JOE BIDEN: The economy-
WALLACE: President-
JOE BIDEN: Let me finish.
WALLACE: President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?
JOE BIDEN: Not lower tax for the American people.
WALLACE: But let me-
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me.
WALLACE: You talk about the economy booming. It turns out that in Obama’s final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency.
DONALD TRUMP: They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places. [crosstalk] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen.
JOE BIDEN: Look-
WALLACE: Vice President.
JOE BIDEN: … we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it.
DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming.
JOE BIDEN: He blew it.
DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929.
WALLACE: Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-
DONALD TRUMP: When COVID came along.
WALLACE: … when there was record low unemployment before COVID.
