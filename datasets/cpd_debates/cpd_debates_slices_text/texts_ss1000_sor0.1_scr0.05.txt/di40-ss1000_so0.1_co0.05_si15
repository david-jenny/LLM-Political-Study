JOE BIDEN: How’s that?
PAUL RYAN: You can — you can cut tax rates by 20 percent and still preserve these important preferences for middle-class taxpayers…
JOE BIDEN: Not mathematically possible.
PAUL RYAN: It is mathematically possible. It’s been done before. It’s precisely what we’re proposing.
JOE BIDEN: It has never been done before.
PAUL RYAN: It’s been done a couple of times, actually.
JOE BIDEN: It has never been done before.
PAUL RYAN: Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth. Ronald Reagan…
JOE BIDEN: Oh, now you’re Jack Kennedy?
(LAUGHTER)
PAUL RYAN: Ronald Reagan — Republicans and Democrats…
JOE BIDEN: This is amazing.
PAUL RYAN: Republican and Democrats have worked together on this.
JOE BIDEN: That’s right.
PAUL RYAN: You know, I understand you guys aren’t used to doing bipartisan deals…
JOE BIDEN: But we told each other what we’re going to do.
PAUL RYAN: Republicans and Democrats…
JOE BIDEN: When we did it Reagan, we said, here — here are the things we’re going to cut.
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: That’s what we said.
PAUL RYAN: We said here’s the framework, let’s work together to fill in the details. That’s exactly…
JOE BIDEN: Fill in the detail.
PAUL RYAN: That’s how you get things done. You work with Congress — look, let me say it this way.
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: That’s coming from a Republican Congress working bipartisanly, 7 percent rating? Come on.
PAUL RYAN: Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, where 87 percent of the legislators he served, which were Democrats. He didn’t demonize them. He didn’t demagogue them. He met with those party leaders every week. He reached across the aisle. He didn’t compromise principles.
JOE BIDEN: And you saw what happened.
PAUL RYAN: He found common ground — and he balanced the budget…
JOE BIDEN: You saw — if he did such a great job…
RADDATZ: Vice President…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: … four times without raising taxes…
JOE BIDEN: Why isn’t he even contesting Massachusetts?
(CROSSTALK)
RADDATZ: Vice President, what would you suggest — what would you suggest beyond raising taxes on the wealthy, that would substantially reduce the long-term deficit?
JOE BIDEN: Just let the taxes expire like they’re supposed to on those millionaires. We don’t — we can’t afford $800 billion going to people making a minimum of $1 million. They do not need it, Martha. Those 120,000 families make $8 million a year. Middle-class people need the help. Why does my friend cut out the tuition tax credit for them? Why does he go after the childcare…
RADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits?
JOE BIDEN: Why do they do that?
RADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits?
PAUL RYAN: Yeah, we’re saying close loopholes…
RADDATZ: Home mortgage deduction?
PAUL RYAN: … on high-interest people.
RADDATZ: Home mortgage deduction?
PAUL RYAN: For higher-income people. Here…
JOE BIDEN: Can you guarantee that no one making less than $100,000 will have a mortgage — their mortgage deduction impacted? Guarantee?
PAUL RYAN: This taxes a million small businesses. He keeps trying to make you think that it’s just some movie star or hedge fund guy or an actor…
JOE BIDEN: Ninety-seven percent of the small businesses make less than $250,000 a year, would not be affected.
PAUL RYAN: Joe, you know it hits a million — this taxes a million people, a million small businesses.
JOE BIDEN: Does it tax 97 percent of the American businesses?
