DONALD TRUMP: Chris, I think it’s…
WALLACE: OK.
DONALD TRUMP: I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico. Very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals. Believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody. It’s a disaster.
Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts. Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn’t built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
WALLACE: Well, let me—wait, wait, sir, let me…
DONALD TRUMP: We are a country of laws. We either have—and by the way…
WALLACE: Now, wait. I’d like to hear from…
DONALD TRUMP: Well—well, but she said one thing.
WALLACE: I’d like to hear—I’d like to hear from Secretary Clinton.
HILLARY CLINTON: I voted for border security, and there are…
DONALD TRUMP: And the wall.
HILLARY CLINTON: There are some limited places where that was appropriate. There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.
But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.
Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can’t exploit them and undercut Americans’ wages.
And Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: “You complain, I’ll get you deported.”
I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.
WALLACE: Trump?
DONALD TRUMP: President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They’ve been deported. She doesn’t want to say that, but that’s what’s happened, and that’s what happened big league.
As far as moving these people out and moving—we either have a country or we don’t. We’re a country of laws. We either have a border or we don’t.
Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen. But it’s very unfair. We have millions of people that did it the right way. They’re on line. They’re waiting. We’re going to speed up the process, big league, because it’s very inefficient. But they’re on line and they’re waiting to become citizens.
Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders. You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.
WALLACE: I want to…
DONALD TRUMP: But what she doesn’t say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to…
HILLARY CLINTON: We will not have open borders. That is…
WALLACE: Well, let me—Secretary…
HILLARY CLINTON: That is a rank mischaracterization.
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton…
HILLARY CLINTON: We will have secure borders, but we’ll also have reform. And this used to be a bipartisan issue. Ronald Reagan was the last president…
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, excuse me. Secretary Clinton.
HILLARY CLINTON: … to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we’ve learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote. “My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.” So that’s the question…
DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.
