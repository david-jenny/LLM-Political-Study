DONALD TRUMP: I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-
JOE BIDEN: Show us your tax returns.
DONALD TRUMP: I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year.
JOE BIDEN: Show us your tax returns.
DONALD TRUMP: You’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company.
WALLACE: Sir, I’m asking you a specific question, which is-
DONALD TRUMP: But let me tell you-
WALLACE: I understand all of that.
JOE BIDEN: Release your tax return.
WALLACE: I understand all of that-
DONALD TRUMP: Let me-
WALLACE: No, President, I’m asking you a question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?
DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars.
WALLACE: You paid millions of dollars in-
DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars, yes.
WALLACE: So not 750?
DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars. And you’ll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it.
JOE BIDEN: When?
DONALD TRUMP: But let me just tell you-
JOE BIDEN: In [crosstalk]?
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We built the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama Administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s-
WALLACE: Vice President Biden, you want to respond?
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s okay.
JOE BIDEN: And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help.
DONALD TRUMP: But why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?
JOE BIDEN: Because you weren’t president-
DONALD TRUMP: Why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?
JOE BIDEN: Because you weren’t president and screwing things up.
DONALD TRUMP: You were a Senator and [crosstalk]-
JOE BIDEN: You’re the worst president America has ever had. Come on.
DONALD TRUMP: Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe. We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing.
WALLACE: Okay. Gentlemen?
DONALD TRUMP: Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts.
WALLACE: President, we’re talking about the economy. I’d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Vice President, your economic plan-
DONALD TRUMP: He has none.
