DONALD TRUMP: He made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it.
WALLACE: Okay.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: What he did is he said. . .
WALLACE: Okay, we’re going to get into a new segment. Vice President, Vice President. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . .is he called the military stupid bastards.
JOE BIDEN: I did not say that.
DONALD TRUMP: He said it on tape. . . [crosstalk]
JOE BIDEN: Not true.
DONALD TRUMP: . . .He said “stupid bastards.”
WALLACE: Sir. [crosstalk] Stop.
JOE BIDEN: Play it.
DONALD TRUMP: I would never say that.
JOE BIDEN: Play it.
WALLACE: Go ahead.
DONALD TRUMP: You’re on tape.
WALLACE: Vice President answered his final question.
JOE BIDEN: The final question is, I can’t remember which of all his rantings was the final question.
WALLACE: [laughing] I’m having a little trouble myself, but…
JOE BIDEN: Yeah.
WALLACE: And about the economy and about this question of what it’s going to cost.
JOE BIDEN: The economy. . .
WALLACE: The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will do.
JOE BIDEN: The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants, we’re gonna build. . .
WALLACE: So, do you support the Green New Deal?
JOE BIDEN: Pardon me?
WALLACE: Do you support the . . .
JOE BIDEN: No, I don’t support the Green New Deal.

JOE BIDEN: I support the Biden plan that I put forward.
WALLACE: Okay.
JOE BIDEN: The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls “The Radical Green New Deal.”
WALLACE: All right, gentlemen, final segment: Election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some ballots–mail-in ballots–after election day.
