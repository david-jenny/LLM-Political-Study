WALLACE: Secretary Clinton…
HILLARY CLINTON: … we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches…
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is—this is an open discussion.
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, it is an open discussion. And you…
WALLACE: And the specific question went to pay for play. Do you want to talk about that?
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, but there is no—but there is no evidence—but there is…[crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: I think that it’s been very well…
WALLACE: Let’s ask Trump.
HILLARY CLINTON: There is a lot of evidence about the very good work…
DONALD TRUMP: It’s been very well studied.
HILLARY CLINTON: … and the high rankings…[crosstalk]
WALLACE: Please let Trump speak.
DONALD TRUMP: … and it’s a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.
WALLACE: Please let Trump speak.
[crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: It’s a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women’s rights? So these are people that push gays off business—off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money.
So I’d like to ask you right now, why don’t you give back the money that you’ve taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don’t you give back the money? I think it would be a great gesture.
Because she takes a tremendous amount of money. And you take a look at the people of Haiti. I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida. And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what’s happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace. And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent—90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country. I’m very proud of that. We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations. And I’d be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six-foot portrait of Donald. I mean, who does that? It just was astonishing.
But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere. The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti. Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years. The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.
We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else. And we’re going to keep working to help Haiti…
WALLACE: All right.
HILLARY CLINTON: … because it’s an important part of the American experience.
DONALD TRUMP: They don’t want you to help them anymore.
[crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: I’d like to mention one thing. Trump Foundation, small foundation. People contribute, I contribute. The money goes 100 percent—100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military. I don’t get anything. I don’t buy boats. I don’t buy planes. What happens—the money goes to them.
WALLACE: Wasn’t some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?
DONALD TRUMP: No, it was—we put up the American flag. And that’s it. They put up the American flag. We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.
WALLACE: Right. But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation…
DONALD TRUMP: There was. There was. And, by the way…
WALLACE: … instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: … the money—the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses—the money that you’re talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.
