DONALD TRUMP: You just don’t know.
JOE BIDEN: Here’s the deal. I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP: You don’t know.
WALLACE: Let him finish.
JOE BIDEN: The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, uh, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It’s important that people know. Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings. But it’s amazing, it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a self-sense, a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and, and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, and grew up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They look down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re gonna bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on, and we can defeat racism in America.
WALLACE: Vice President… I mean, President Trump, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: During the Obama-Biden Administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at, uh, Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very…many places. Look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened a . . . Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now.
JOE BIDEN: Oh my Lord.
DONALD TRUMP: But the reason-
JOE BIDEN: This is ridiculous.
DONALD TRUMP: … is that the Democrats that run these cities-
JOE BIDEN: Absolutely ridiculous.
DONALD TRUMP: … don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order.
JOE BIDEN: Violent crime. . .
DONALD TRUMP: And you still haven’t mentioned.
JOE BIDEN: Violent crime. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order?
JOE BIDEN: I’m in favor of law. You follow a little bit of order- [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? [crosstalk]
JOE BIDEN: Yes I’m in favor of. . .
WALLACE: You asked a question, let him finish. [crosstalk] Let him answer.
JOE BIDEN: Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly.
DONALD TRUMP: Okay.
JOE BIDEN: And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17 percent, 15 percent in our Administration. It’s gone up on his watch.
WALLACE: Okay.
DONALD TRUMP: It went down much more in ours.
WALLACE: All right, we’re done- [crosstalk] President, you’re going to be very happy because we’re now going to talk about law and order.
DONALD TRUMP: The places we had trouble were Democratic-run cities. . .
WALLACE: That’s exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on Democratic mayors and Democratic governors. But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican-led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?
DONALD TRUMP: I think it’s a party issue. You can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where, uh, 53 people were shot and eight died. Shot. If you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100, 150, 200 percent, uh, crime, it is crazy what’s going on . . .
JOE BIDEN: Republican cities, republican cities.
