DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming.
JOE BIDEN: He blew it.
DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929.
WALLACE: Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-
DONALD TRUMP: When COVID came along.
WALLACE: … when there was record low unemployment before COVID.
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, Chris, wait.
JOE BIDEN: … number one. Number two-
DONALD TRUMP: Chris.
JOE BIDEN: Number three.
DONALD TRUMP: They said it would take… No, you’re on number two.
JOE BIDEN: No.
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, Chris. They said it would take-
JOE BIDEN: This guy-
DONALD TRUMP: … a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing.
JOE BIDEN: We did not. [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: … standard fare.
JOE BIDEN: I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry.
DONALD TRUMP: He totally gave up on manufacturing.
WALLACE: All right, let him-
JOE BIDEN: I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. We brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They’re gone. He blew it. And in fact, they’re gone-
DONALD TRUMP: Ohio had the best year it’s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you. [crosstalk].
WALLACE: Vice President, go ahead.
JOE BIDEN: And so you take a look at what he’s actually done. He’s done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China’s perfected the art of the steal. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit-
DONALD TRUMP: China ate your lunch- [crosstalk].
JOE BIDEN: … with Mexico.
DONALD TRUMP: China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and, wha–, he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we’re at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave your son three and a half million dollars?
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: What did he do to deserve it? What did he do with Burisma-
JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.
DONALD TRUMP: … to deserve $183,000?
WALLACE: Sir, you’ve asked him a question, let him answer it.
JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh really, he didn’t get three and a half million?
WALLACE: President-
JOE BIDEN: Is totally-
WALLACE: President, please. You’ve asked a question- [crosstalk]
JOE BIDEN: Totally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way-
DONALD TRUMP: Well wait, he didn’t get three and a half million dollars, Joe?
JOE BIDEN: Vice-
DONALD TRUMP: He got three and a half million dollars-
WALLACE: President.
DONALD TRUMP: … dollars.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really?
WALLACE: President, it’s an open discussion. Please- [crosstalk]
