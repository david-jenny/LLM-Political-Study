McGEE: Niven with a question for Senator Kennedy.
NIVEN: Senator, while the main theme of your campaign has been this decline of American power and prestige in the last eight years, you’ve hardly criticized President Eisenhower at all. And in a speech last weekend you said you had no quarrel with the President. Now isn’t Eisenhower and not Nixon responsible for any such decline?
JOHN KENNEDY: Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh – propaganda that I’ve read. The question is what we’re going to do in the future. I’ve been critical of this Administration and I’ve been critical of the President. In fact uh – Nixon uh – discussed that a week ago in a speech. I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined. Now what is the issue is what we’re going to do in the future. Now that’s an issue between Nixon and myself. He feels that we’re moving ahead uh – in a – we’re not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we’re moving ahead. I disagree. And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we’re doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Nixon’s view. That’s the great issue. President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years. And that’s the debate. That’s the argument between Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it’s a important judgment. I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century. Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that’s going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties. If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America – the President of Brazil – the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America. In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh – Africa. We gave more scholarships to the Congo – this summer we offered them – than we’ve given to all of Africa the year before. Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything. We’ve been uh – having a very clear decision in the last eight years. Nixon has been part of that Administration. He’s had experience in it. And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we’re facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here – unless we start to go ahead – I don’t believe that we’re going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom. I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.
McGEE: Vice President.
RICHARD NIXON: Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility. In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh – had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions. I’m glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience. Let me make my position cl ear. I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration. I’m proud of the record of this Administration. I don’t stand on it because it isn’t something to stand on but something to build on. Now looking at Senator Kennedy’s credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will. But what does he offer? He offers retreads of programs that failed. I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh – free money or loose money uh – high – low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration. And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more ...
