JOE BIDEN: He’s absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, when, during our Administration in the Recovery Act, I was able, was in charge, able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than or as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody’s gonna build another, uh, coal fired plant in America. No one’s going to build another oil fire plant in America. They’re going to move to renewable energy, number one,
Number two, we’re going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that’s run on, that’re electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we’re going to put 500,000 charging stations and all of the highways that we’re going to be building in the future. We’re going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will –they’ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out.
There’s so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs. Creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green.
And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what’s happening. It’s all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no, no relationship to, with foreign policy. Brazil, the rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More, more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the comp–countries of the world coming up with 20 billion dollars, and say, “Here’s $20 billion. Stop, stop tearing, tearing down the forest. And if you don’t, then you’re going to have significant economic consequences.”
WALLACE: What about, what about the argument that President Trump basically says, that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests? And he’s drawn his line.
JOE BIDEN: Well, he hadn’t drawn a line. He still, for example, makes sure that we, he wants to make sure that methane’s not a problem. We can, you, you can now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don’t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. This is the guy who says that, well the fact is. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Not true. Not true.
JOE BIDEN: It’s all true. And here’s the deal. . .
DONALD TRUMP: He’s talking about the Green New Deal. And it’s not 2 billion or 20 billion, as you said. It’s 100 trillion dollars.
JOE BIDEN: I’m. . . I’m. . . .I’m talking about the Biden plan. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Where they want to rip down buildings. . .
WALLACE: [to Biden] Let him go for a minute, and then you can go.
DONALD TRUMP: And rebuild the building.
JOE BIDEN: No.
DONALD TRUMP: It’s the dumbest-
JOE BIDEN: That is not, that is not. . .
DONALD TRUMP: … most ridiculous. . . Where airplanes are out of business. Where two car systems are out. . .
JOE BIDEN: Not true. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . . where they want to take out the cows too.
JOE BIDEN: Not true.
DONALD TRUMP: You know, that’s not true either, right?
JOE BIDEN: Not true.
DONALD TRUMP: This is, this is a 100 trillion. . .
JOE BIDEN: Simply. . . Look-
DONALD TRUMP: That’s more money than our country could make in a hundred years if it were. . .
