MODERATOR: Vice President Gore?
ALBERT GORE: I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I’m sorry about that. And I’m going to try to do better. One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make. However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesn’t change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that. There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes. More sometimes than people in foreign countries. And we need to do something about that. Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president’s term of four years is over. But right away. And that means doing it under the Medicare program. I can’t promise that I will never get another detail wrong. I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard. But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I’m elected president, I’ll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.
MODERATOR: Does that resolve the issue, Governor?
GEORGE W. BUSH: That’s going to be up to the people, isn’t it?
MODERATOR: Does it resolve it for you?
GEORGE W. BUSH: Depends on what he says in the future in the campaign.
MODERATOR: Your folks are saying some awful things.
GEORGE W. BUSH: I hope they’re not awful things. I think they may be using the man’s own words.
MODERATOR: Well, what I mean is calling him a serial exaggerator —
GEORGE W. BUSH: I don’t believe I’ve used those words.
MODERATOR: No, but your campaign ads.
GEORGE W. BUSH: Maybe they have.
MODERATOR: And your campaign officials have. And your campaign officials, Vice President, are now calling the governor a bumbler.
GEORGE W. BUSH: Wait a minute. (LAUGHTER)
MODERATOR: I mean, my point is, should this — is this —
ALBERT GORE: I don’t use language like that and I don’t think that we should.
MODERATOR: It’s in your commercial.
ALBERT GORE: I understand. The — I haven’t seen that, in my commercials?
GEORGE W. BUSH: You haven’t seen the commercial?
MODERATOR: Your —
ALBERT GORE: I think that what — I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy. I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person.
GEORGE W. BUSH: That’s the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about. (LAUGHTER)
ALBERT GORE: Well, I wasn’t the one having trouble explaining it.
MODERATOR: Gentlemen, it’s time to go to the closing statements. And Vice President Gore, you have two minutes.
ALBERT GORE: Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it’s an example of the overall approach that I think is important. This race is about values, it’s about change, it’s about giving choices to the American people. And education is my number one priority, because I think that it’s the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn’t stop there. Because I want to give new choices to parents. To send their kids to college ...
