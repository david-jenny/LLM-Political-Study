DONALD TRUMP: With what?
JOE BIDEN: And tonight I’m going to make sure.
DONALD TRUMP: With what?
JOE BIDEN: Because here’s the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie. I’m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he’s a liar.
DONALD TRUMP: But you agree. Joe, you’re the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class.
JOE BIDEN: God, I want to make sure-
WALLACE: President, can you let him finish, sir?
JOE BIDEN: No, he doesn’t know how to do that.
DONALD TRUMP: You’d be surprised. You’d be surprised. Go ahead, Joe.
JOE BIDEN: The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time.
DONALD TRUMP: Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto.
JOE BIDEN: There is no manifesto, number one.
WALLACE: Please let him speak, President.
JOE BIDEN: Number two.
DONALD TRUMP: He just lost the left.
JOE BIDEN: Number two.
DONALD TRUMP: You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk], they call it socialized medicine.
WALLACE: President.
JOE BIDEN: I’ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare.
DONALD TRUMP: Who is, Bernie?
JOE BIDEN: Because he, in fact, already has cost 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do. Take it away.
DONALD TRUMP: No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good.
JOE BIDEN: He doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how to do that.
DONALD TRUMP: I’ve already fixed it.
JOE BIDEN: He has never offered a plan.
DONALD TRUMP: We’ve already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good.
WALLACE: Gentlemen, you realize if you’re both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster. It’s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better.
WALLACE: I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time.
DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.
WALLACE: Please let the Vice President talk, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: Good.
JOE BIDEN: He has no plan for healthcare.
DONALD TRUMP: Of course, we do.
WALLACE: Please.
JOE BIDEN: He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn’t lowered drug costs for anybody. He’s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn’t have a plan. ...
