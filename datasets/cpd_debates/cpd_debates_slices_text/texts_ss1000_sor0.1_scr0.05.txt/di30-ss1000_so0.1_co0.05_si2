JOE BIDEN: ... , in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here’s the deal. The deal is that it’s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there’s seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?
DONALD TRUMP: Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don’t tell me about this.
JOE BIDEN: I’m happy to talk about this.
DONALD TRUMP: And if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban Europe.
WALLACE: All right, gentlemen, President.
DONALD TRUMP: You would have been much later, Joe, much later.
WALLACE: President.
DONALD TRUMP: We’re talking about two million people.
JOE BIDEN: You’re not going to be able to shut him up.
WALLACE: President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment. But go ahead.
JOE BIDEN: Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That’s on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that’s also at stake right now. And so the election is all-
DONALD TRUMP: You don’t know what’s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It’s not on the ballot.
JOE BIDEN: It’s on the ballot in the court.
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t think so.
JOE BIDEN: In the court.
DONALD TRUMP: There’s nothing happening there.
JOE BIDEN: Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.
DONALD TRUMP: You don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don’t know her view.
WALLACE: Well, all right. All right. Let’s talk. We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We’ve got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V. Wade.
JOE BIDEN: All right.
WALLACE: President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s right.
WALLACE: You have spent the last week-
DONALD TRUMP: Because they want to give good healthcare.
WALLACE: If I may ask my question, sir.
JOE BIDEN: Good healthcare.
WALLACE: Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.
DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate.
WALLACE: [crosstalk] when I finish I’m going to give an opportunity-
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare.
WALLACE: That’s not a comprehensive place.
DONALD TRUMP: That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.
WALLACE: I didn’t ask, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare.
WALLACE: You’re debating him not me. Let me ask my question.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.
WALLACE: President.
DONALD TRUMP: I got rid of it. And we will protect people.
WALLACE: President, I’m the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.
DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.
