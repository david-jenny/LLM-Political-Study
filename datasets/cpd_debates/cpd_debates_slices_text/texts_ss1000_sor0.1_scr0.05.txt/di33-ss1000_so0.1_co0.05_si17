LEHRER: Senator Dole, at the Republican convention you said the following and I quote, it is demeaning to the nation that within the Clinton Administration a core of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving schemes, end quote. Whom precisely and what precisely did you have in mind?
ROBERT DOLE: I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies who’ve never been had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldn’t be in the administration. And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.
Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things. I feel strongly about education. I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights. We’ve had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.
Now the reason they don’t have, The reason the President can’t support this is pretty obvious. It’s not taking anything away from schools, it’s new money. It’s not being taken away from anybody else, except we’ll downsize the Department of Education. But this is a very liberal administration. This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut. This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system. This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business. This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, that’s what I had in mind.
I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America. There won’t be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet. There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who’ve made it and know the hard knocks in life.
WILLIAM CLINTON: When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, all the young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, President, I know how you grew up, who is he talking about. And you know this liberal charge, that’s what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race. It’s sort of their golden oldie, you know. It’s a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear. And I just don’t think that dog will hunt this time.
The American people should make up their own mind. Here’s the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War — I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too. We’ve got ten and a half million new jobs; we’ve got record numbers of those new small businesses. We’ve made every one of them eligible for a tax cut. We’ve got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban. The American people can make up their mind about whether that’s a liberal record or a record that’s good for America. Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.
ROBERT DOLE: Well, I think it’s pretty liberal, I’ll put that label on it. You take a look at all the programs you’ve advocated, President. Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there. The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we’ve got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion. And even some in your own party couldn’t buy that.
I remember talking by the telephone. I’m not even certain you were too excited about that. I won’t, I never repeat what I’ve talked to the President about. In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion. And then came some other program, and then came healthcare, and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed, and I think we’ve done a good job.
LEHRER: President, if you’re not a liberal, describe your political philosophy.
