DONALD TRUMP: So is it President Obama’s fault?
HILLARY CLINTON: … before you even announced.
DONALD TRUMP: Is it President Obama’s fault?
HILLARY CLINTON: Look, there are differences…
DONALD TRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama’s fault?
HILLARY CLINTON: There are…
DONALD TRUMP: Because he’s pushing it.
HILLARY CLINTON: There are different views about what’s good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it’s important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That’s why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.
DONALD TRUMP: But you have no plan.
HILLARY CLINTON: But in—oh, but I do.
DONALD TRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan.
HILLARY CLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about it. It’s called “Stronger Together.” You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore…
DONALD TRUMP: That’s about all you’ve…

HOLT: Folks, we’re going to…
HILLARY CLINTON: … or at an airport near you.
HOLT: We’re going to move to…
HILLARY CLINTON: But it’s because I see this—we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.
So we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.
DONALD TRUMP: You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you’re going to increase regulations all over the place.
And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I’m very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.
When I go around—Lester, I tell you this, I’ve been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing—the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I’m cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.
I’m going to cut regulations. I’m going to cut taxes big league, and you’re going to raise taxes big league, end of story.
HOLT: Let me get you to pause right there, because we’re going to move into—we’re going to move into the next segment. We’re going to talk taxes…
HILLARY CLINTON: That can’t—that can’t be left to stand.
HOLT: Please just take 30 seconds and then we’re going to go on.
HILLARY CLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so…
DONALD TRUMP: Facts.
HILLARY CLINTON: So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we’ve turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed…
DONALD TRUMP: And take a look at mine, also, and you’ll see.
HILLARY CLINTON: … would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it’s time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.
HOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, could I just finish—I think I…
