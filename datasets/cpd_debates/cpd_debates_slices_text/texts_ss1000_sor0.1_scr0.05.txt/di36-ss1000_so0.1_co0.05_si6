GEORGE H. BUSH: ... a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education. I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing. But we got to have a knowledge base. Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge. We can’t simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing. I’m Chairman of the President’s Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help. And you got to be careful here, because there’s a safety factor, but I think these things – and then also I am one who believes we’ve got to go the extra mile in clean – being sure that that blood supply is pure. We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature. So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.
LEHRER: Next question will be asked by Peter Jennings. It goes to the Governor.
JENNINGS: Good evening, Vice President, Governor. Governor, one theme that keeps coming up about the way you govern – you’ve both mentioned leadership tonight, so I’d like to stay with that for a second. The theme that keeps coming up about the way you govern is passionless, technocratic –
MICHAEL DUKAKIS: Passionless?
JENNINGS: Passionless, technocratic, the smartest clerk in the world. Your critics maintain that in the 1960’s your public passion was not the war in Vietnam or civil rights, but no fault auto insurance. And they say in the 1970’s you played virtually no role in the painful busing crisis in Boston. Given the fact that a president must sometimes lead by sheer inspiration and passion. We need to know if this is a fair portrait of your governing or if it is a stereotype. And if it isn’t fair, give us an example of where you have had that passion and leadership that sometimes a president needs?
LEHRER: Vice President, a rebuttal.
GEORGE H. BUSH: Well, I don’t question his passion. I question – and I don’t question his concern about the war in Vietnam. He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war. Now, that’s a certain passion that in my view it’s misguided passion. He – we have a big difference on issues. You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion. He said, “I am a strong liberal Democrat” – August, ’87. Then he said, “I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.” That was what he said. He is out there on out of the mainstream. He is very passionate. My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left. And I wish we had time to let me explain. But I salute him for his passion. We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.
(Applause)
LEHRER: Peter, a question? Question for the vice president, Peter.
JENNINGS: I’d actually like to follow up if I may on this mention you’ve made of his card carrying membership in the American Civil Liberties Union. You’ve used the phrase “card carrying” so many times since Governor Dukakis first acknowledged that he was a card carrying member of the ACLU that some people have come to believe that you’ve used it to brand him in some way, to identify him as people were identified in the 1950’s as less than patriotic. I’d like to know why you keep repeating the phrase, and what’s the important issue here? What is so wrong with the governor being a member of an organization which has come to the defense of, among other people, Colonel Oliver North?
GEORGE H. BUSH: Nothings wrong with it. But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU. But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don’t like it when I say that he says he’s a card carrying member. Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here. I’ve seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I’ve done him an injustice, and he didn’t say it, I’m very, very sorry. But I don’t agree with a lot of – most of the positions of the ACLU. I simply don’t want to see the ratings on movies. I don’t want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie. I like those ratings systems. I don’t think they’re right to try to take the tax exemption ...
