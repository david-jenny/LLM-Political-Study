JOHN MCCAIN: Well, if you’ll turn on the television, as I — I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.
BARACK OBAMA: Congratulations.
JOHN MCCAIN: Every other ad — ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan. And any objective observer has said it’s not true. You’re running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research. I don’t.
You’re running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration. So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented — unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.
And of course, I’ve been talking about the economy. Of course, I’ve talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I’m not going to spread his wealth around. I’m going to let him keep his wealth. And of course, we’re talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.
That’s what my campaign is all about and that’s what it’ll continue to be all about.
But again, I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman…
BARACK OBAMA: I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign’s awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like “terrorist” and “kill him,” and that you’re running mate didn’t mention, didn’t stop, didn’t say “Hold on a second, that’s kind of out of line.”
And I think Congressman Lewis’ point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.
Now…
JOHN MCCAIN: You’ve got to read what he said…
(CROSSTALK)
BARACK OBAMA: Let — let — let… JOHN MCCAIN: You’ve got to read what he said.
BARACK OBAMA: Let me — let me complete…
SCHIEFFER: Go ahead.
BARACK OBAMA: … my response. I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we don’t think that comparison is appropriate.
And, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.
The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth. And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that’s what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign.
JOHN MCCAIN: I cannot…
BARACK OBAMA: We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we…
JOHN MCCAIN: We do and I hope…
BARACK OBAMA: … talking about it this evening.
JOHN MCCAIN: Sure.
BARACK OBAMA: But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we’re not talking about issues. What we’re talking about…
JOHN MCCAIN: Well, let me just say I would…
SCHIEFFER: (inaudible)
JOHN MCCAIN: Let me just say categorically I’m proud of the people that come to our rallies. Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you’re going to have some fringe peoples. You know that. And I’ve — and we’ve always said that that’s not appropriate.
But to somehow say that group of young women who said “Military wives for McCain” are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything — and those veterans that wear those hats that say “World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,” I’m not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they’re great citizens.
And I’m not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally — there’s a ...
