MICHAEL PENCE: ... were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula. Donald Trump knew that happened. He basically was saying it’s not going to happen again. The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had — increased its influence in Iran, that’s now — now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear — the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted.
And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that — Syria is imploding. You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo. ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa. It is — ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier — I get all that — in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure. I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day…
TIM KAINE: We wiped out the leader of Al Qaida.
MICHAEL PENCE: … on the day that Iran released four American hostages…
TIM KAINE: We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
QUIJANO: Governor…
MICHAEL PENCE: … we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.

QUIJANO: Governor, yesterday, Trump said…
TIM KAINE: And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot.
QUIJANO: … quote, “Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton and no respect for Obama.” Why do you think he’ll respect a Trump-Pence administration?
MICHAEL PENCE: Strength. Plain and simple.
TIM KAINE: Business dealings.
MICHAEL PENCE: Donald Trump — that’s nonsense. Donald Trump is a strong leader…
TIM KAINE: Donald Trump’s son says that the Trump organization…
MICHAEL PENCE: … who is going to lead with American strength.
QUIJANO: Please, Senator, I’ll give you a chance to respond.
MICHAEL PENCE: We’re going to rebuild our military. And let me — let me — this whole Putin thing. Look, America is stronger than Russia. Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy. America’s political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way.
When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I’ve said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that’s stating painful facts. That’s not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin. That’s an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership…
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine?
MICHAEL PENCE: … of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
TIM KAINE: Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it. But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.
MICHAEL PENCE: That is absolutely inaccurate.
TIM KAINE: And — and — and I just think a guy who praises…
MICHAEL PENCE: He said he’s stronger — he’s been stronger on the world stage.
TIM KAINE: No, he said leader. And if — and I’ll just say this, Governor.
MICHAEL PENCE: You just said better.
TIM KAINE: If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can’t tell the difference, a country that’s running its economy into the ground…
MICHAEL PENCE: Yeah, here we go. This is the grade school thing again?
TIM KAINE: … persecuting journalists…
MICHAEL PENCE: Right, this is grade school.
TIM KAINE: … if you can’t tell the difference, you shouldn’t be commander-in-chief.
MICHAEL PENCE: Yeah.
TIM KAINE: And with Donald Trump — Donald Trump’s sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia. Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them. Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America’s bottom line or his own bottom line.
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, what went wrong with the Russia reset?
