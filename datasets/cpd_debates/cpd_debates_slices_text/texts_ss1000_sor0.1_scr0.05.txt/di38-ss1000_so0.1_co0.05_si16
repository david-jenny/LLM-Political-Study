MICHAEL PENCE: Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all?
QUIJANO: You can — you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please.
MICHAEL PENCE: First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week. We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country. And I look forward if I’m privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort.
TIM KAINE: We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit.
MICHAEL PENCE: We have an intelligence, sir. But I will also tell you that it’s important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it…
QUIJANO: And I don’t — 30 seconds is on up.
MICHAEL PENCE: … about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there.
QUIJANO: Right.
MICHAEL PENCE: Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: I’d like to ask you about Syria, Governor.
MICHAEL PENCE: We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn’t have a private server.
[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: A full investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step. You don’t get to decide the rights and wrongs of this. We have a justice system that does that. And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: All right, we are moving on now. Two hundred fifty thousand people…
MICHAEL PENCE: If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did…
QUIJANO: … one hundred thousand of them children — Governor…
MICHAEL PENCE: … they’d be court martialed.
TIM KAINE: That is absolutely false and you know that.
MICHAEL PENCE: Absolutely true.
TIM KAINE: And you know that, Governor.
QUIJANO: Governor…
MICHAEL PENCE: It’s absolutely true.
QUIJANO: Gentlemen, please.
TIM KAINE: Because the FBI did an investigation.
QUIJANO: Gentlemen.
TIM KAINE: And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further. Sorry.
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please.
TIM KAINE: Syria.
QUIJANO: I want to turn now to Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria. Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries. Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence?
MICHAEL PENCE: The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo. Hillary Clinton’s top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russian reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea.
And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America — the greatest nation on Earth — just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins — look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership.
It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. We’ve got to work with the Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world.
But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen.
And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength ...
