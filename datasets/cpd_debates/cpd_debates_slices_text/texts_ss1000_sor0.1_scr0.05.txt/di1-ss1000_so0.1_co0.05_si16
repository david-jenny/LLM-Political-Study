DANFORTH QUAYLE: Do you support a 24-hour waiting period?
ALBERT GORE: Let me finish this, briefly. Now — now you want to waffle around on it and give the impression that maybe you don’t really mean what you say. But again, you can clear it up by simply repeating I support the right of a woman to choose. Say it.
BRUNO: Let him say it himself. Let him say his own words. Go ahead, Mr Vice President.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Thank you. Talk about waffling around. This issue is a very important issue. It has been debated throughout your public life and throughout my public life, and one thing that I don’t think that it is wise to do, and that is to change your position.
At one time, and most of the time in the House of Representatives, you had a pro-life position.
ALBERT GORE: That’s simply not true.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: In 1987, you wrote a letter, and we’ll pass this out to the media —
ALBERT GORE: That is simply not true.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: You wrote a letter saying that you oppose taxpayer funding of abortion. Bill Clinton has the same type of a record.
ALBERT GORE: In some circumstances.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: You’re going to qualify it now.
ALBERT GORE: And I still do.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: And Bill Clinton, when he was governor of Arkansas, also worked with the Right to Life people and supported Right to Life positions and now he has changed. Talk about waffling around. This is the typical type of Clinton response. Even on the issue like abortion. He’s on both sides of the issue.
Take the NAFTA agreement —
ALBERT GORE: Well, wait —
BRUNO: Let’s stick with the question, Mr Vice President.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: How long did he have —
ALBERT GORE: I know you want to change the subject, Dan, but let’s stay on this one for a while.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: How long did he have to wait — or how quickly did he change his position on education? He changes his position all the time.
ALBERT GORE: Let’s stay with this issue for a while.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Bill Clinton — Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth. 3 words he fears most in the English language.
BRUNO: Does anybody have any view about the appointment of judges on this?
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Tell the truth.
ALBERT GORE: Yeah, I want to talk about this, because the question was not about free trade or education. The question —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Talk about waffling. You’re the one who brought up the —
ALBERT GORE: Now, I let you talk.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: — issue of waffling. He’s waffled on the abortion issue.
ALBERT GORE: I let you talk. Let me talk now. It’s going to be a long evening if you’re like this, now.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Oh, no, it’s not —
ALBERT GORE: Don’t change the subject —
BRUNO: Let’s get on with it. Gentlemen, let’s get on with it.
ALBERT GORE: Don’t change the subject —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Well, answer my questions, then.
ALBERT GORE: What you have done —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Answer my questions. On the 24 hour waiting period — do you support that?
ALBERT GORE: I have had the same position —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Do you support that?
ALBERT GORE: I have had the same position on abortion in favor of a woman’s right to choose. Do you support a woman’s right to choose —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Do you support a 24 hour waiting period to have —
ALBERT GORE: You’re still avoiding —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: How about avoiding the question?
