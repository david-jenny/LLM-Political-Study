TIM KAINE: But they told you there’s a right way and a wrong way to do it.
MICHAEL PENCE: But, look, if you’re going to be critical of me on that, that’s fair game. I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris’ 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state.
TIM KAINE: But, Governor Pence…
MICHAEL PENCE: So you bet I suspended that program.
TIM KAINE: But, Governor Pence, I just…
MICHAEL PENCE: And I stand by that decision. And if I’m vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we’re going to put the safety and security of the American people first.
TIM KAINE: Sure. Can we just be clear — Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we’ll vet refugees based on whether they’re dangerous or not. We won’t do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice.
MICHAEL PENCE: But the problem with that…
TIM KAINE: That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of…[crosstalk]
MICHAEL PENCE: Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can’t know for certain who these people are coming from Syria.
TIM KAINE: Yes, we can, and when we don’t let them know, we don’t let them in.
MICHAEL PENCE: So — the FBI…
TIM KAINE: When we don’t know who they are, we don’t let them in.
MICHAEL PENCE: The FBI and homeland security said we can’t know for certain. You’ve got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator. I understand the…
TIM KAINE: By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims?
MICHAEL PENCE: … the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program…
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, let me ask you this. Secretary Clinton…
MICHAEL PENCE: We’re going to put the safety and security of the American people first.
QUIJANO: … has talked about an intelligence surge.
TIM KAINE: Yes.
QUIJANO: What exactly would an intelligence surge look like? And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization?
TIM KAINE: Intelligence surge is two things, Elaine. It’s two things. It’s, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we’ve got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies.
So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence.
But the second piece of this is really, really important. It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies. And that’s how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come from one country to the next. Alliances are critical.
That’s why Donald Trump’s claim that he wants to — that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.
MICHAEL PENCE: That’s not his plan.
TIM KAINE: Well, he said NATO is obsolete. And, look, if you put aside — push aside your alliances, who you’re going to share intelligence with? Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances. She built the sanctions regime around the world that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. And that’s what an intelligence surge means. Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances.
QUIJANO: All right. I’d like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand…
MICHAEL PENCE: Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all?
QUIJANO: You can — you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please.
