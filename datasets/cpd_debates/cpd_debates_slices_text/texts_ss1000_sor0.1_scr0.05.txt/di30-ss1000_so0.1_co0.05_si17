DONALD TRUMP: My family-
WALLACE: No, no- [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP: My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with government.
JOE BIDEN: And that’s such a- [crosstalk]
WALLACE: President-
DONALD TRUMP: Every single one of them lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with government.
JOE BIDEN: This is not about my family or his family. It’s about your family, the American people. [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: And he got three and a half million dollars for nothing.
JOE BIDEN: That’s not true. It doesn’t want to talk about what you need. You, the American people. It’s about you. That’s what we’re talking about here. [crosstalk]
WALLACE: That’s the end of the segment. We’re moving on.
JOE BIDEN: He didn’t take that.
WALLACE: Vice President-
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, can I be honest? It’s a very important question-
JOE BIDEN: Try to be honest.
WALLACE: No.
DONALD TRUMP: He stood up-
WALLACE: The answer to the question is no.
DONALD TRUMP: … and he threatened Ukraine-
WALLACE: Sir-
DONALD TRUMP: … with a billion dollars-
JOE BIDEN: That is absolutely not true.
WALLACE: Stop. [crosstalk] Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I- [crosstalk] Why should I be different than the two of you? So here’s the deal.
JOE BIDEN: That’s a good point.
WALLACE: We have six segments. We have ended that segment. We’re going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments. In those two uninterrupted minutes, President, you can say anything you want. I’m going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But we, I, I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I’m appealing to you, sir, to do that.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, and him too.
WALLACE: Well, frankly, you’ve been doing more interrupting than he has.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, that’s all right, but he does plenty.
WALLACE: Well, sir, less than-
DONALD TRUMP: He does plenty.
WALLACE: No, less than you have. Let’s please continue on. The issue of race. Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh yeah, sure.
WALLACE: President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s true.
WALLACE: My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first.
JOE BIDEN: It’s about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It’s about the Constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require, acquire equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people. . . Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, spewing–just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed, and they asked the president what he thought. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that. [crosstalk].
WALLACE: It is his-
JOE BIDEN: Now-
