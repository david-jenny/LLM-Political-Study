STOCKDALE: Okay. I thought this was just an open session, this 5-minute thing, and I didn’t have anything to add to his. But I will —
ALBERT GORE: Well, I’ll jump in if you don’t want —
(Laughter)
DANFORTH QUAYLE: I thought anyone could jump in whenever they wanted to.
BRUNO: Okay, whatever pleases you gentlemen is fine with me. You’re the candidates.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: But I want Admiral Stockdale’s time.
(Laughter and applause)
BRUNO: This is not the Senate, where you can trade off time. Go ahead, Senator Gore.
ALBERT GORE: I’ll let you all figure out the rules, I’ve got some points that I want to make here, and I still haven’t gotten an answer to my question on when you guys are going to start worrying about this country, but I want to elaborate on it before —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Why doesn’t the Democratic Congress — why doesn’t the Democratic Congress pass the presidentâ€™s bill?
BRUNO: Vice President, let him say his thoughts, and then you can come in.
ALBERT GORE: I was very patient in letting you get off that string of attacks. We’ve been listening to —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Good points.
ALBERT GORE: — trickle-down economics for 12 years now, and you all still support trickle-down to the very last drop. And, you know, talking about this point of concentrating on every other country in the world as opposed to the people of our country right here at home, when George Bush took former Secretary of State Baker out of the State Dept and put him in charge of the campaign and made him chief of staff in the White, Baker, who’s quite a capable man, said that for these last 4 years George Bush was working on the problems of the rest of the world and in the next 4 years he would target America. Well, I want you to know we really appreciate that. But Bill Clinton and I will target America from day one. We won’t wait 4 years before we concentrate on the problems in this country. He went on to say that it’s really amazing what George Bush can do when he concentrates. Well, it’s time that we had a president like Bill Clinton who can concentrate and will concentrate and work on the problems of real people in this country. You know, our country is in trouble. We simply cannot continue with this philosophy of giving huge tax cuts to the very wealthy, raising taxes on middle income families the way Bush and Quayle have done and then waiting for it to work. How much longer will it take, Dan, for trickle down economics to work, in your theory?
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Well, we’re going to have plenty of time to talk about trickle down government, which you’re for. But the question —
ALBERT GORE: Well, I’d like to hear the answer.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: But the question is — the question is — and which you have failed to address, and that is, why is Bill Clinton qualified to be president of the US. You’ve talked about —
ALBERT GORE: Oh, I’ll be happy to answer that question —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: You’ve talked about Jim Baker. You’ve talked about trickle down economics. You’ve talked about the worst economy-
BRUNO: Now, wait a minute. The question was about —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: — in 50 years.
ALBERT GORE: I’ll be happy to answer those. May I answer —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Why is he qualified to be president of the US?
ALBERT GORE: I’ll be happy to —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: I want to go back and make a point —
ALBERT GORE: Well, you’ve asked me the question. If you won’t answer my question I will answer yours.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: I have not asked you a question. I’ve made a statement. I have not asked you a question, Iâ€™ve made a statement that you have not told us why Bill Clinton is qualified to be president of the US. I pointed out what he said about the Persian Gulf War. But let me repeat it for you. Here’s what he said, Senator. You know full well what he said.
