QUIJANO: Gentlemen, this is about Syria. I’d like to…[crosstalk]
MICHAEL PENCE: Honestly, Senator. Honestly, Senator.
TIM KAINE: It is about our troops. It is about our troops.
MICHAEL PENCE: I understand why you want to change — I understand why you want to change the subject.
TIM KAINE: How can you support the troops if you won’t pay taxes?
MICHAEL PENCE: I understand why you want to change the subject. And let me be very clear on this Russian thing. The larger question here…
TIM KAINE: Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes?
QUIJANO: Gentlemen, we’re going to have time to get to Russia here.
MICHAEL PENCE: What we’re dealing with is the — you know, there’s an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates. And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East.
And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we’re not having talks anymore. To answer your question, we just need American strength. We need to — we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm’s way.
QUIJANO: And exactly how would those safe zones work? How would they remain safe?
MICHAEL PENCE: The — the safe zones would have to be — as the senator said, there’s already a framework for this that’s been recognized by the international community. The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone.
But, look, this is very tough stuff. I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade. I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years. I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration…
TIM KAINE: Well, let me — let me come back…
MICHAEL PENCE: … is deeply troubling to me. That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States.
TIM KAINE: … and talk about — let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn’t want to acknowledge, Elaine. He doesn’t want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. He doesn’t want to acknowledge…
MICHAEL PENCE: You didn’t.
TIM KAINE: … that Hillary was part of the team that got bin Laden. He doesn’t want to acknowledge…
MICHAEL PENCE: I just did.
TIM KAINE: … that it’s a good thing, not a bad thing, that it’s a good thing — not a bad thing — that we’re down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000.
But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous. Donald Trump’s idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea. Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s. He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event. And I think that’s who Governor Pence’s running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about.
MICHAEL PENCE: And come on. Senator. Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton. And that — that’s pretty low.
TIM KAINE: But do you — do you think — do you think we should have — more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer?
MICHAEL PENCE: Senator, the…
TIM KAINE: That’s what Donald Trump thinks.
MICHAEL PENCE: Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won. And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence…
TIM KAINE: But can you defend Donald Trump’s claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons?
