GEORGE H. BUSH: Now we have a chance. Now we have a chance. And, so, I think that I’d leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record. And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega. Now, I’ve told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that. He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I’ll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.
(Applause)
GEORGE H. BUSH: I still have a couple of minutes left. And there is a difference principle –
LEHRER: Sorry, Vice President.
GEORGE H. BUSH: It’s only on yellow here. Wait a minute.
(Laughter)
LEHRER: I’m wrong. Go ahead. My apologies.
GEORGE H. BUSH: Jim –
LEHRER: You said nobody’s perfect.
GEORGE H. BUSH: I said I wasn’t perfect. Where was I?
MICHAEL DUKAKIS: 25th of December, Vice President.
(Laughter)
GEORGE H. BUSH: I finished.
MICHAEL DUKAKIS: He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim.
LEHRER: Governor, you have a minute to respond.
MICHAEL DUKAKIS: Well, the matter of judgment is very important. And I think it’s important to understand what happened here.
A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism. They were ignored. The Vice President ignored them. He says mistakes were made. Very serious mistakes in judgment were made. He says, â‰¥Well, let’s concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega. Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.â‰¤
I think those are very very serious questions of judgment, which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review. We’re not going to make those kinds of mistakes. You cannot make concessions to terrorists. If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages. That’s a basic principle. It was ignored in that case and it was a very very serious mistake in judgment.
LEHRER: A question from John Mashek. It goes to the Vice President.
MASHEK: Vice President, Democrats and even some Republicans are still expressing reservations about the qualifications and credentials of Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana, your chosen running mate, to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. What do you see in him that others do not?
(Laughter)
GEORGE H. BUSH: I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice, to the House of Representatives twice. I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30Ï€s and 40Ï€s. I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society we’re in, so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefit-for a-work that will be productive and he won’t have to go on one of these many programs that the liberal-talking about.
I see a young man who is a knowledgeable-in defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable-in the whole-in the race-knowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them. And I believe that he will be outstanding. And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding. And I’d like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal. And he’s kept his head up. And he will do very very well. And he has my full confidence and he’ll have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ï€s and 40Ï€s and more. So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.
My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle. Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in ...
