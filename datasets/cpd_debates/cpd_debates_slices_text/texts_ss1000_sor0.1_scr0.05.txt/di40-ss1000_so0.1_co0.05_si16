JOE BIDEN: Ninety-seven percent of the small businesses make less than $250,000 a year, would not be affected.
PAUL RYAN: Joe, you know it hits a million — this taxes a million people, a million small businesses.
JOE BIDEN: Does it tax 97 percent of the American businesses?
PAUL RYAN: It taxes a million small businesses…
JOE BIDEN: Small businesses?
PAUL RYAN: … who are our greatest job creators.
JOE BIDEN: I wish I’d get — the “greatest job creators” are the hedge fund guys.
RADDATZ: And you’re — and you’re going to increase the defense budget.
PAUL RYAN: Think about it this way.
RADDATZ: And you’re going to increase the defense budget.
PAUL RYAN: No, we’re not just going to cut the defense budget like they’re — they’re proposing…
JOE BIDEN: They’re going to increase it $2 billion.
PAUL RYAN: That’s not…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: We’re talking about… RADDATZ: So no massive defense increases?
PAUL RYAN: No, we’re saying don’t — OK, you want to get into defense now?
RADDATZ: Yes, I do. I do, because that’s another math question.
PAUL RYAN: So — right, OK.
RADDATZ: How do you do that?
PAUL RYAN: So they proposed a $478 billion cut to defense to begin with. Now we have another $500 billion cut to defense that’s lurking on the horizon. They insisted upon that cut being involved in the debt negotiations, and so we have a $1 trillion cut…
RADDATZ: Let’s put the automatic defense cuts aside, OK?
PAUL RYAN: Right, OK.
RADDATZ: Let’s put those aside. No one wants that.
JOE BIDEN: I’d like to go back to that.
RADDATZ: But I want to know how you do the math and have this increase in defense spending?
JOE BIDEN: Two trillion dollars.
PAUL RYAN: You don’t cut defense by a trillion dollars. That’s what we’re talking about.
RADDATZ: And what — what national security issues justify an increase?
JOE BIDEN: Who’s cutting it by $1 trillion?
PAUL RYAN: We’re going to cut 80,000 soldiers, 20,000 Marines, 120 cargo planes. We’re going to push the Joint Strike Fighter out…
RADDATZ: Drawing down in one war and one war…
PAUL RYAN: If these cuts go through, our Navy will be the smallest — the smallest it has been since before World War I.
This invites weakness. Look, do we believe in peace through strength? You bet we do. And that means you don’t impose these devastating cuts on our military.
So we’re saying don’t cut the military by a trillion dollars. Not increase it by a trillion, don’t cut it by a trillion dollars.
RADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President Biden on this. I want to move on.
JOE BIDEN: Look, we don’t cut it. And I might add, this so-called — I know we don’t want to use the fancy word “sequester,” this automatic cut — that was part of a debt deal that they asked for.
And let me tell you what my friend said at a press conference announcing his support of the deal. He said, and I’m paraphrase, We’ve been looking for this moment for a long time.
PAUL RYAN: Can I tell you what that meant?
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: We’ve been looking for bipartisanship for a long time.
JOE BIDEN: And so the bipartisanship is what he voted for, the automatic cuts in defense if they didn’t act.
And beyond that, they asked for another — look, the military says we need a smaller, leaner Army, we need more special forces, we need — we don’t need more M1 tanks, what we need is more UAVs ...
