HILLARY CLINTON: ... the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.
So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. We’ve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election. We have 17—17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election. I find that deeply disturbing.
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton…
HILLARY CLINTON: And I think it’s time you take a stand…
DONALD TRUMP: She has no idea whether it’s Russia, China, or anybody else.
HILLARY CLINTON: I am not quoting myself.
DONALD TRUMP: She has no idea.
HILLARY CLINTON: I am quoting 17…
DONALD TRUMP: Hillary, you have no idea.
HILLARY CLINTON: … 17 intelligence—do you doubt 17 military and civilian…
DONALD TRUMP: And our country has no idea.
HILLARY CLINTON: … agencies.
DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, I doubt it. I doubt it.
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, he’d rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just absolutely…[crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: She doesn’t like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.
WALLACE: Trump…
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.
WALLACE: Trump…[crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: He’s outsmarted her every step of the way.
WALLACE: I’m not a potted plant here, I do get to ask some questions.
DONALD TRUMP: Yes, that’s fine.
WALLACE: And I would like to ask you this direct question. The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks. Even if you don’t know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?
DONALD TRUMP: By Russia or anybody else.
WALLACE: You condemn their interference?
DONALD TRUMP: Of course I condemn. Of course I—I don’t know Putin. I have no idea.
WALLACE: I’m not asking—I’m asking do you condemn?
DONALD TRUMP: I never met Putin. This is not my best friend. But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn’t be so bad.
Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way. Whether it’s Syria, you name it. Missiles. Take a look at the “startup” that they signed. The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can’t believe they allowed us to do this. They create warheads, and we can’t. The Russians can’t believe it. She has been outsmarted by Putin.
And all you have to do is look at the Middle East. They’ve taken over. We’ve spent $6 trillion. They’ve taken over the Middle East. She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I’ve ever seen in any government whatsoever.
WALLACE: We’re a long way away from immigration, but I’m going to let you finish this topic. You got about 45 seconds.
DONALD TRUMP: And she always will be.
HILLARY CLINTON: I—I find it ironic that he’s raising nuclear weapons. This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. He’s…
DONALD TRUMP: Wrong.
HILLARY CLINTON: … advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia. He said, well, if we have them, why don’t we use them, which I think is terrifying.
But here’s the deal. The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There’s about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that’s why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald ...
