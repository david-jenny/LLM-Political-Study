WALLACE: What about, what about the argument that President Trump basically says, that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests? And he’s drawn his line.
JOE BIDEN: Well, he hadn’t drawn a line. He still, for example, makes sure that we, he wants to make sure that methane’s not a problem. We can, you, you can now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don’t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. This is the guy who says that, well the fact is. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Not true. Not true.
JOE BIDEN: It’s all true. And here’s the deal. . .
DONALD TRUMP: He’s talking about the Green New Deal. And it’s not 2 billion or 20 billion, as you said. It’s 100 trillion dollars.
JOE BIDEN: I’m. . . I’m. . . .I’m talking about the Biden plan. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Where they want to rip down buildings. . .
WALLACE: [to Biden] Let him go for a minute, and then you can go.
DONALD TRUMP: And rebuild the building.
JOE BIDEN: No.
DONALD TRUMP: It’s the dumbest-
JOE BIDEN: That is not, that is not. . .
DONALD TRUMP: … most ridiculous. . . Where airplanes are out of business. Where two car systems are out. . .
JOE BIDEN: Not true. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . . where they want to take out the cows too.
JOE BIDEN: Not true.
DONALD TRUMP: You know, that’s not true either, right?
JOE BIDEN: Not true.
DONALD TRUMP: This is, this is a 100 trillion. . .
JOE BIDEN: Simply. . . Look-
DONALD TRUMP: That’s more money than our country could make in a hundred years if it were. . .
JOE BIDEN: That is simply not the case. . .
DONALD TRUMP: It would destroy our country.
WALLACE: All right. Let me. Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, some, the president is saying, I think, some people who support the president would say, that sounds like it’s going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy.
JOE BIDEN: What it’s going to do, it’s going to create thousands and millions of jobs. Good paying jobs.
DONALD TRUMP: Hundred trillion dollars.
WALLACE: Let him finish, sir.
JOE BIDEN: He doesn’t know how to do that.
DONALD TRUMP: 100 trillion dollars.
JOE BIDEN: The fact is, it’s going to create millions of good-paying jobs. And these tax incentives to people, for people to weatherize, which he wants to get, get rid of. It’s going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we’re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, with, deal with. . . By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may go away.
DONALD TRUMP: I never said that at all.
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, you did say that.
DONALD TRUMP: They made it up.
JOE BIDEN: And here’s the deal. . .
DONALD TRUMP: You make up a lot.
JOE BIDEN: . . . we’re going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. We’re in real trouble. Look what’s happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn’t happen before. They’re because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world’s problem. We in fact, but the rest of the world, we’ve got to get them to come along. That’s why we have to get back into, back into the Paris Accord.
WALLACE: All right, gentlemen. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute, Chris. So why didn’t he do it for 47 years? You were Vice-President?
JOE BIDEN: For 47?
DONALD TRUMP: So why didn’t you get the world—China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars. . .
JOE BIDEN: That is not my plan.
DONALD TRUMP: . . .not 20 billion. . . .
JOE BIDEN: The Green New Deal is not my plan. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . . You want to rebuild every building.
JOE BIDEN: . . . If you knew anything about. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Well, you want to rebuild everything
JOE BIDEN: If he knew anything about. . .
WALLACE: Gentlemen. . . Gentlemen. . .
DONALD TRUMP: He made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it.
WALLACE: Okay.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: What he did is he said. . .
WALLACE: Okay, we’re going to get into a new segment. Vice President, Vice President. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . .is he called the military stupid bastards.
JOE BIDEN: I did not say that.
DONALD TRUMP: He said it on tape. . . [crosstalk]
JOE BIDEN: Not true.
DONALD TRUMP: . . .He said “stupid bastards.”
WALLACE: Sir. [crosstalk] Stop.
JOE BIDEN: Play it.
DONALD TRUMP: I would never say that.
JOE BIDEN: Play it.
WALLACE: Go ahead.
DONALD TRUMP: You’re on tape.
WALLACE: Vice President answered his final question.
JOE BIDEN: The final question is, I can’t remember which of all his rantings was the final question.
WALLACE: [laughing] I’m having a little trouble myself, but…
JOE BIDEN: Yeah.
WALLACE: And about the economy and about this question of what it’s going to cost.
JOE BIDEN: The economy. . .
WALLACE: The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will do.
JOE BIDEN: The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants, we’re gonna build. . .
WALLACE: So, do you support the Green New Deal?
JOE BIDEN: Pardon me?
WALLACE: Do you support the . . .
JOE BIDEN: No, I don’t support the Green New Deal.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement.
JOE BIDEN: I support . . .
DONALD TRUMP: You just lost the radical left. It’s done. Oh you don’t?
JOE BIDEN: I support the Biden plan that I put forward.
WALLACE: Okay.
JOE BIDEN: The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls “The Radical Green New Deal.”
WALLACE: All right, gentlemen, final segment: Election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some ballots–mail-in ballots–after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election. In this final segment, Vice President, you go first.
JOE BIDEN: Prepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com. Decide how they’re going to vote, when they’re going to vote, and what means by which they’re going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida. Number one.
Number two, we’re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he’s trying to conf–to scare people into thinking that it’s not going to be legitimate.
Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you’re able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you’re able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you. Because you will—he cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not, when the votes are counted and they’re all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that’ll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he’s not sure what he’s going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn’t matter, because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. He’s gonna go. He can’t stay in power. ...
