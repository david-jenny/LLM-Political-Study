DONALD TRUMP: There’s nothing happening there.
JOE BIDEN: Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.
DONALD TRUMP: You don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don’t know her view.
WALLACE: Well, all right. All right. Let’s talk. We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We’ve got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V. Wade.
JOE BIDEN: All right.
WALLACE: President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s right.
WALLACE: You have spent the last week-
DONALD TRUMP: Because they want to give good healthcare.
WALLACE: If I may ask my question, sir.
JOE BIDEN: Good healthcare.
WALLACE: Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.
DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate.
WALLACE: [crosstalk] when I finish I’m going to give an opportunity-
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare.
WALLACE: That’s not a comprehensive place.
DONALD TRUMP: That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.
WALLACE: I didn’t ask, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare.
WALLACE: You’re debating him not me. Let me ask my question.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.
WALLACE: President.
DONALD TRUMP: I got rid of it. And we will protect people.
WALLACE: President, I’m the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.
DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.
WALLACE: You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?
DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay. I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There’s nothing symbolic. I’m cutting drug prices. I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47-year period in government, but you didn’t do it. Nobody’s done it. So we’re cutting healthcare.
WALLACE: What about pre-existing conditions?
DONALD TRUMP: All of the things that we’ve done.
JOE BIDEN: He has not done healthcare.
DONALD TRUMP: I’ll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing. Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do.
WALLACE: Okay, like I say, this is open discussion.
DONALD TRUMP: This is big stuff.
WALLACE: Sir, you’ll be happy. I’m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare.
JOE BIDEN: Yes.
WALLACE: And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.
JOE BIDEN: It is not.
WALLACE: If I start asking the question.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s not what your party says, by the way.
WALLACE: And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of healthcare.
JOE BIDEN: It does not. It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two.
DONALD TRUMP: Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine.
JOE BIDEN: Look, hey.
DONALD TRUMP: Are you saying you didn’t agree?
JOE BIDEN: I’m not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.
DONALD TRUMP: Not by much.
JOE BIDEN: I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.
DONALD TRUMP: Not by much.
JOE BIDEN: I’m here standing facing you, old buddy.
DONALD TRUMP: If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.
JOE BIDEN: All he knows how to do-
DONALD TRUMP: On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky.
JOE BIDEN: Look he’s the deal. I got very lucky. I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well.
DONALD TRUMP: With what?
JOE BIDEN: And tonight I’m going to make sure.
DONALD TRUMP: With what?
JOE BIDEN: Because here’s the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie. I’m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he’s a liar.
DONALD TRUMP: But you agree. Joe, you’re the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class.
JOE BIDEN: God, I want to make sure-
WALLACE: President, can you let him finish, sir?
JOE BIDEN: No, he doesn’t know how to do that.
DONALD TRUMP: You’d be surprised. You’d be surprised. Go ahead, Joe.
JOE BIDEN: The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time.
DONALD TRUMP: Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto.
JOE BIDEN: There is no manifesto, number one.
WALLACE: Please let him speak, President.
JOE BIDEN: Number two.
DONALD TRUMP: He just lost the left.
JOE BIDEN: Number two.
DONALD TRUMP: You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk], they call it socialized medicine.
WALLACE: President.
JOE BIDEN: I’ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare.
DONALD TRUMP: Who is, Bernie?
JOE BIDEN: Because he, in fact, already has cost 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do. Take it away.
DONALD TRUMP: No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good.
JOE BIDEN: He doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how to do that.
DONALD TRUMP: I’ve already fixed it.
JOE BIDEN: He has never offered a plan.
DONALD TRUMP: We’ve already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good.
WALLACE: Gentlemen, you realize if you’re both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster. It’s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better.
WALLACE: I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time.
DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.
WALLACE: Please let the Vice President talk, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: Good.
JOE BIDEN: He has no plan for healthcare.
DONALD TRUMP: Of course, we do.
WALLACE: Please.
JOE BIDEN: He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn’t lowered drug costs for anybody. He’s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn’t have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
WALLACE: All right, I have one final question for you.
JOE BIDEN: Sure.
