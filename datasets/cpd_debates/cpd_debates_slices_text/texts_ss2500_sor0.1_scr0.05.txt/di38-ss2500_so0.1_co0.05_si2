MICHAEL PENCE: Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the “you’re hired,” “you’re fired” thing, Senator. You use that a whole lot. And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.
Look, what — what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government. And if you think that’s all working, then you look at the other side of the table. I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch. We’re in the…
TIM KAINE: Fifteen million new jobs?
MICHAEL PENCE: … slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.
TIM KAINE: Fifteen million new jobs?
QUIJANO: Governor…[crosstalk]
MICHAEL PENCE: There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side…
TIM KAINE: And the poverty level and the median income…
MICHAEL PENCE: … stepped into the Oval Office.
TIM KAINE: … improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015.
MICHAEL PENCE: You — honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different. People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different. I mean, this economy is struggling. The answer to this economy is not more taxes.
TIM KAINE: But it’s not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top.
MICHAEL PENCE: It’s not more spending…[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: I am interested to hear whether he’ll defend his running mate’s not releasing taxes and not paying taxes.
MICHAEL PENCE: Absolutely I will.
QUIJANO: Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine. And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine — God bless you for it, career public servants, that’s great — Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business.
Those tax returns that were — that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what’s called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.
TIM KAINE: But why won’t he release his tax returns?
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, we’re answering the question about — about a business thing, is he…
TIM KAINE: I do want to come back to that, but…
MICHAEL PENCE: His tax returns — his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it’s supposed to be used. And he did it brilliantly.
TIM KAINE: How do you know that? You haven’t seen his tax returns.
MICHAEL PENCE: He created a runway — because he’s created a business that’s worth billions of dollars today.
TIM KAINE: How do you know that?
MICHAEL PENCE: And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn’t pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs. And he’s paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes…
TIM KAINE: Elaine, let me talk about something.
QUIJANO: Senator, I’m going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you.
TIM KAINE: OK.
MICHAEL PENCE: The only issue on taxes — Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them.
TIM KAINE: Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, “If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes.” He’s broken his first…
MICHAEL PENCE: And he will.
TIM KAINE: He’s broken his first promise. Second, he stood on the stage…
MICHAEL PENCE: He hasn’t broken his promise. He said he’s…
TIM KAINE: He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven’t been paying taxes, he said, “That makes me smart.” So it’s smart not to pay for our military? It’s smart not to pay for veterans? It’s smart not to pay for teachers? And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we’re stupid. And the last thing I’ll say is this…
MICHAEL PENCE: Senator, do you take all the deductions that you’re entitled to?
TIM KAINE: The last thing — the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is…
MICHAEL PENCE: I do.
TIM KAINE: Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president. Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he’s qualified to be president. And he’s breaking his promise.
MICHAEL PENCE: Elaine, I have to respond to this.
QUIJANO: You get very little time, 20 seconds.
MICHAEL PENCE: I’ll be — I’ll be very respectful.
QUIJANO: Governor?
MICHAEL PENCE: Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires.
TIM KAINE: But he said he would release his tax returns.
QUIJANO: All right, Gentlemen…
MICHAEL PENCE: The American people can review that. And he’s going — Senator, he’s going to release his tax returns when the audit is over…
QUIJANO: … I need to ask you about Social Security…
TIM KAINE: Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.
MICHAEL PENCE: They’re going to raise your taxes. We’re going to cut your taxes.
QUIJANO: Gentlemen…
TIM KAINE: If you can’t meet Nixon’s standard…
QUIJANO: The people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other. I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished.
TIM KAINE: All right. We’re having fun up here.
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you’ll be 76. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year. What would your administration do to prevent this cut?
TIM KAINE: First, we’re going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done. It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty. And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty.
We have to keep it solvent. And we will keep it solvent. And we’ll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that.
Here’s what Hillary and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.
And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security. Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it. We’re going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security. And we’ll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap.
QUIJANO: Governor Pence, I’ll give you an opportunity to respond.
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, thanks, Elaine. There they go again. OK…
TIM KAINE: Go read — go read the book.
MICHAEL PENCE: All Donald Trump — all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we’re going to meet our obligations to our seniors. That’s it.
TIM KAINE: Go read the book.
MICHAEL PENCE: We’ve said we’re going to meet the obligations of Medicare. That’s what this campaign is really about, Senator. And I get, this is — this is the old scare tactic that they roll out…
TIM KAINE: But — but you have a voting record, Governor.
MICHAEL PENCE: And I get all of that. I just, look…
TIM KAINE: I…
MICHAEL PENCE: There’s a question that you asked a little bit earlier that I want to go back to.
TIM KAINE: I can’t believe that you won’t defend your own voting record.
MICHAEL PENCE: I have to go back to.
QUIJANO: We…
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, look, I — you’re running with Hillary Clinton, who wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion, increase spending by $2 trillion, and you say you’re going to keep the promises of Social Security. Donald Trump and I are going to cut taxes. We’re going to — we’re going to — we’re going to…
TIM KAINE: You’re not going to cut taxes. You’re going to raise taxes on the middle class.
MICHAEL PENCE: … reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare.
QUIJANO: All right.
MICHAEL PENCE: Stay on the path that your party has us on, we’re going to be in a — in a mountain range of debt. And we’re going to face hard choices and…[crosstalk]
Gentleman, I want to move on now.
TIM KAINE: You did ask this question about debt, and the debt explosion on the Trump plan is much, much bigger than anything on the Clinton side.
QUIJANO: All right. Let me move on now…
MICHAEL PENCE: Three hundred and five economists said your plan is bad for the economy.
