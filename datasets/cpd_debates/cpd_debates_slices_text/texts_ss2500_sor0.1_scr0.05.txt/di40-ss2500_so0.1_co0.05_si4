JOE BIDEN: ... Medicare. We cut the cost of Medicare. We stopped overpaying insurance companies, doctors and hospitals. The AMA supported what we did. AARP endorsed what we did. And it extends the life of Medicare to 2024. They want to wipe this all out.
It also gave more benefits. Any senior out there, ask yourself: Do you have more benefits today? You do. If you’re near the donut hole, you have $800 — $600 more to help your prescription drug costs. You get wellness visits without co-pays. They wipe all of this out, and Medicare goes — becomes insolvent in 2016, number one.
Number two, “guaranteed benefit”? It’s a voucher. When they first proposed — when the congressman had his first voucher program, the CBO said it would cost $6,400 a year, Martha, more for every senior, 55 and below, when they got there. He knew that, yet he got all the guys in Congress and women in the Republican Party to vote for it. Governor Romney, knowing that, said, I would sign it, were I there.
Who you believe, the AMA, me, a guy who’s fought his whole life for this, or somebody who would actually put in motion a plan that knowingly cut — added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?
Now they got a new plan: “Trust me, it’s not going to cost you any more.” Folks, follow your instincts on this one.
And with regard to Social Security, we will not — we will not privatize it. If we had listened to Romney, Governor Romney, and the congressman during the Bush years, imagine where all those seniors would be now if their money had been in the market.
Their ideas are old and their ideas are bad, and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare.
PAUL RYAN: Here’s the problem. They got caught with their hands in the cookie jar, turning Medicare into a piggybank for Obamacare. Their own actuary from the administration came to Congress and said one out of six hospitals and nursing homes are going to go out of business as a result of this.
JOE BIDEN: That’s not what they said.
PAUL RYAN: 7.4 million seniors are projected to lose their current Medicare Advantage coverage they have. That’s a $3,200 benefit cut.
JOE BIDEN: That didn’t happen.
PAUL RYAN: What we’re saying…
JOE BIDEN: More people signed up.
PAUL RYAN: These are from your own actuaries.
JOE BIDEN: More — more — more people signed up for Medicare Advantage after the change.
PAUL RYAN: What — there’s…
JOE BIDEN: Nobody is…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: Vice President, I know…
JOE BIDEN: No, this is…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: Vice President, I know you’re under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don’t keep interrupting each other.
JOE BIDEN: Well, don’t take all the four minutes then.
PAUL RYAN: Let me just — let me just say this. We are not — we’re saying don’t change benefits for people 55 and above. They already organized their retirement around these promises.
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: … programs for those of us.
RADDATZ: But let — let me ask you this. What — what is your specific plan for seniors who really can’t afford to make up the difference in the value of what you call a premium support plan and others call a voucher?
PAUL RYAN: Hundred percent coverage…
RADDATZ: And what…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: That’s what we’re saying. So we’re saying…
RADDATZ: How do you make that up?
PAUL RYAN: … income adjusts (inaudible) these premium support payments by taking down the subsidies for wealthy people.
Look, this is a plan — by the way, that $6,400 number, it was misleading then, it’s totally inaccurate now. This is a plan that’s bipartisan. It’s a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat senator from Oregon.
JOE BIDEN: There’s not one Democrat who endorses it.
PAUL RYAN: It’s a plan…
JOE BIDEN: Not one Democrat who (inaudible).
PAUL RYAN: Our partner is a Democrat from Oregon.
JOE BIDEN: And he said he does no longer support (inaudible).
PAUL RYAN: We — we — we put it — we put it together with the former Clinton budget director.
JOE BIDEN: Who disavows it.
PAUL RYAN: This idea — this idea came from the Clinton commission to save Medicare chaired by Senator John Breaux.
Here’s the point, Martha.
JOE BIDEN: Which was rejected.
PAUL RYAN: If we don’t — if we don’t fix this problem pretty soon then current seniors get cut. Here’s the problem: 10,000 people are retiring every single day in America today and they will for 20 years. That’s not a political thing, that’s a math thing.
JOE BIDEN: Martha, if we just did one thing, if we just — if they just allowed Medicare to bargain for the cost of drugs like Medicaid can, that would save $156 billion right off the bat.
PAUL RYAN: And it would deny seniors choices.
JOE BIDEN: All — all — all…
PAUL RYAN: It has a restricted…
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: Seniors are not denied.
PAUL RYAN: Absolutely.
JOE BIDEN: They are not denied.
Look, folks, all you seniors out there, have you been denied choices? Have you lost Medicare Advantage.
PAUL RYAN: Because it’s working well right now.
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: Because we’ve changed the law.
RADDATZ: Vice President Biden, let me ask you, if it could help solve the problem, why not very slowly raise the Medicare eligibility age by two years, as Congressman Ryan suggests?
JOE BIDEN: Look, I was there when we did that with Social Security in 1983. I was one of eight people sitting in the room that included Tip O’Neill negotiating with President Reagan. We all got together and everybody said, as long as everybody’s in the deal, everybody’s in the deal, and everybody is making some sacrifice, we can find a way.
We made the system solvent to 2033. We will not, though, be part of any voucher plan eliminating — the voucher says, “Mom, when you’re — when you’re 65, go out there, shop for the best insurance you can get. You’re out of Medicare.” You can buy back in if you want with this voucher, which will not keep pace — will not keep pace with health care costs. Because if it did keep pace with health care costs, there would be no savings. That’s why they go the voucher. They — we will be no part of a voucher program or the privatization of Social Security.
PAUL RYAN: A voucher is you go to your mailbox, get a check, and buy something. Nobody’s proposing that. Barack Obama four years ago running for president said if you don’t have any fresh ideas, use stale tactics to scare voters. If you don’t have a good record to run on, paint your opponent as someone people should run from.
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: Make a big election about small ideas.
RADDATZ: You were one of the few lawmakers to stand with President Bush when he was seeking to partially privatize Social Security.
PAUL RYAN: For younger people. What we said then, and what I’ve always agreed is let younger Americans have a voluntary choice of making their money work faster for them within the Social Security system.
JOE BIDEN: You saw how well that worked.
PAUL RYAN: That’s not what Mitt Romney’s proposing. What we’re saying is no changes for anybody 55 and above.
JOE BIDEN: What Mitt Romney is proposing…
PAUL RYAN: And then the kinds of changes we’re talking about for younger people like myself is don’t increase the benefits for wealthy people as fast as everybody else. Slowly raise the retirement age over time.
JOE BIDEN: Martha…
PAUL RYAN: It wouldn’t get to the age of 70 until the year 2103 according to the actuaries.
Now, here’s…
(CROSSTALK)
RADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President?
JOE BIDEN: Quickly. The bottom line here is that all the studies show that if we went with Social Security proposal made by Mitt Romney, if you’re 40 — in your 40s now you will pay $2,600 a year — you get $2,600 a year less in Social Security. If you’re in your 20s now, you get $4,700 (inaudible) less.
The idea of changing, and change being in this case to cut the benefits for people without taking other action you could do to make it work is absolutely the wrong way.
These — look, these guys haven’t been big on Medicare from the beginning. Their party’s not been big on Medicare from the beginning. And they’ve always been about Social Security as little as you can do.
Look, folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this — a man who introduced a bill that would raise it 40 — $6,400 a year; knowing it and passing it, and Romney saying he’d sign it, or me and the president?
PAUL RYAN: That statistic was completely misleading. But more importantly…
JOE BIDEN: That’s — there are the facts right…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: This is what politicians do when they don’t have a record to run on: try to scare people from voting for you. If you don’t get ahead of this problem, it’s going to…
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: Medicare beneficiaries — there are more beneficiaries…
(CROSSTALK)
RADDATZ: We’re going to — we’re going to move…
(CROSSTALK)
RADDATZ: … very simple question…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: We’re not going to run away. Medicare and Social Security did so much for my own family. We are not going to jeopardize this program, but we have to save it…
(CROSSTALK)
