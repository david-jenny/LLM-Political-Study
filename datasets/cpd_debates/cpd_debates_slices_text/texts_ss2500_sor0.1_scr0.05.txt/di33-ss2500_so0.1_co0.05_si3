LEHRER: President.
WILLIAM CLINTON: Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President. That’s what I thought we ought to do.
Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it. And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act. I don’t think that means you’re soft on drugs. We just have a different approach. But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse. I know what it’s like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator. We need to do this together and we can.
LEHRER: Senator Dole, on the government, continuing to talk about the government’s role. If elected President, would you seek to repeal the Brady Bill and the ban on assault weapons?
ROBERT DOLE: Not if I didn’t have a better idea. But I’ve got a better idea. It’s something I’ve worked on for 15 years. It’s called the automated check or the instant check. It’s being used in 17 states right now. States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states. You don’t buy any gun. You don’t get any gun. We’ve got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns. We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns. I’ve been working on this for a long, long time. You walk in, you put your little card in there. If it says tilt, you don’t get any gun. You don’t get a hand gun, you don’t get a rifle, you don’t get a shot gun, you get zippo.
If we’re going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we’ve got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.
The administration says they support the instant check. They’ve appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway. In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite. This keeps up with technology. It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns. That is the bottom line. And I believe it’s a good idea, has strong bipartisan support. And perhaps that’s another thing we can depoliticize.
You talk about the Brady Bill. There has only been one prosecution under the Brady — only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time. And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street. Let’s get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.
LEHRER: President.
WILLIAM CLINTON: Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he’d be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban. And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that’s true I’m grateful for it. But let’s look at the facts here. The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns. Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill. He tried to keep it from coming to my desk. He didn’t succeed and I signed it and I’m glad I did.
Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn’t want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn’t want the Brady Bill. But two years later nobody’s lost their handguns. I mean, their rifles. We’ve expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids. And this is a safer country. So I’m glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.
ROBERT DOLE: Well, the President doesn’t have it quite right. I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective. But that’s history. I told the NRA that’s history. You’re not going to worry about it anymore. I’m not going to worry about it anymore. Let’s do something better. Let’s stop, you know, playing the political game, President. Talking about this and this. You add all the states that’ve used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals. It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned. So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we’ll get the instant check passed and we’ll keep guns out of the hands of criminals.
LEHRER: President, Senator Dole said the other day that you practiced a photo-op foreign policy that has lessened the credibility of the United States throughout the world. Is he wrong about that?
WILLIAM CLINTON: If he, that’s what he said, he’s not right about that. Look at where we are today. The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century. I have worked to support our country as the world’s strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.
We have done the following things: Number one, we’ve managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia. The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics. The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO. And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.
There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age.
We have worked hard for peace and freedom. When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States. When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia. Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti. Peace in Bosnia. We just had the election there. We’ve made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East. We’ve also stood up to the new threats of terrorism. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America’s economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that’s one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.
LEHRER: Senator.
ROBERT DOLE: Well, I have a different view. Again, Iâ€™ve supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year. Now I understand it’s been extended ’til some time next year. But, let’s start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn’t have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers. They didn’t have the weapons, they didn’t have the tanks. They asked for the tanks. They didn’t get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building. It’s called mission creep. We turn it over to the United Nations. The President didn’t have much to do about it. You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago. You got to send down some more people, because the president’s found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property. So we need more protection from America. Bosnia, Northern Ireland. There’s no ceasefire in Bosnia. I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia. We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992. We haven’t done that. We’re way behind, which means Americans can’t come home. Americans shouldn’t have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.
LEHRER: President.
WILLIAM CLINTON: First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia, but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened. I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and let’s not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there.
Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was. Thirdly, in Bosnia it’s a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election. And institutions are beginning to function.
In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago. There will always be problems in this whole world. But if we’re moving in the right direction and America is leading, we’re better off.
LEHRER: Senator Dole, if elected president, what criteria would you use to decide when to send U.S. troops into harm’s way.
ROBERT DOLE: Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement. Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy. Now I think we have a selective engagement policy. We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations’ interests. And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations. They decided.
He’s deployed more troops than any president in history around the world. It’s cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations. Look these are facts. And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief. He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom. That would be my position.
Then I’m going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review. We all fight over how much money is there. I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money. You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion. Devastated states like California and others. And I think now we’ve got a problem. We’ve got to go back and look. It’s just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, President, and you did. You may have said that, too.
But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world. We provide the leadership and we’re going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let’s do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.
