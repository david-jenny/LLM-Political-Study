JOE BIDEN: How’s that?
PAUL RYAN: You can — you can cut tax rates by 20 percent and still preserve these important preferences for middle-class taxpayers…
JOE BIDEN: Not mathematically possible.
PAUL RYAN: It is mathematically possible. It’s been done before. It’s precisely what we’re proposing.
JOE BIDEN: It has never been done before.
PAUL RYAN: It’s been done a couple of times, actually.
JOE BIDEN: It has never been done before.
PAUL RYAN: Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth. Ronald Reagan…
JOE BIDEN: Oh, now you’re Jack Kennedy?
(LAUGHTER)
PAUL RYAN: Ronald Reagan — Republicans and Democrats…
JOE BIDEN: This is amazing.
PAUL RYAN: Republican and Democrats have worked together on this.
JOE BIDEN: That’s right.
PAUL RYAN: You know, I understand you guys aren’t used to doing bipartisan deals…
JOE BIDEN: But we told each other what we’re going to do.
PAUL RYAN: Republicans and Democrats…
JOE BIDEN: When we did it Reagan, we said, here — here are the things we’re going to cut.
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: That’s what we said.
PAUL RYAN: We said here’s the framework, let’s work together to fill in the details. That’s exactly…
JOE BIDEN: Fill in the detail.
PAUL RYAN: That’s how you get things done. You work with Congress — look, let me say it this way.
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: That’s coming from a Republican Congress working bipartisanly, 7 percent rating? Come on.
PAUL RYAN: Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, where 87 percent of the legislators he served, which were Democrats. He didn’t demonize them. He didn’t demagogue them. He met with those party leaders every week. He reached across the aisle. He didn’t compromise principles.
JOE BIDEN: And you saw what happened.
PAUL RYAN: He found common ground — and he balanced the budget…
JOE BIDEN: You saw — if he did such a great job…
RADDATZ: Vice President…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: … four times without raising taxes…
JOE BIDEN: Why isn’t he even contesting Massachusetts?
(CROSSTALK)
RADDATZ: Vice President, what would you suggest — what would you suggest beyond raising taxes on the wealthy, that would substantially reduce the long-term deficit?
JOE BIDEN: Just let the taxes expire like they’re supposed to on those millionaires. We don’t — we can’t afford $800 billion going to people making a minimum of $1 million. They do not need it, Martha. Those 120,000 families make $8 million a year. Middle-class people need the help. Why does my friend cut out the tuition tax credit for them? Why does he go after the childcare…
RADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits?
JOE BIDEN: Why do they do that?
RADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits?
PAUL RYAN: Yeah, we’re saying close loopholes…
RADDATZ: Home mortgage deduction?
PAUL RYAN: … on high-interest people.
RADDATZ: Home mortgage deduction?
PAUL RYAN: For higher-income people. Here…
JOE BIDEN: Can you guarantee that no one making less than $100,000 will have a mortgage — their mortgage deduction impacted? Guarantee?
PAUL RYAN: This taxes a million small businesses. He keeps trying to make you think that it’s just some movie star or hedge fund guy or an actor…
JOE BIDEN: Ninety-seven percent of the small businesses make less than $250,000 a year, would not be affected.
PAUL RYAN: Joe, you know it hits a million — this taxes a million people, a million small businesses.
JOE BIDEN: Does it tax 97 percent of the American businesses?
PAUL RYAN: It taxes a million small businesses…
JOE BIDEN: Small businesses?
PAUL RYAN: … who are our greatest job creators.
JOE BIDEN: I wish I’d get — the “greatest job creators” are the hedge fund guys.
RADDATZ: And you’re — and you’re going to increase the defense budget.
PAUL RYAN: Think about it this way.
RADDATZ: And you’re going to increase the defense budget.
PAUL RYAN: No, we’re not just going to cut the defense budget like they’re — they’re proposing…
JOE BIDEN: They’re going to increase it $2 billion.
PAUL RYAN: That’s not…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: We’re talking about… RADDATZ: So no massive defense increases?
PAUL RYAN: No, we’re saying don’t — OK, you want to get into defense now?
RADDATZ: Yes, I do. I do, because that’s another math question.
PAUL RYAN: So — right, OK.
RADDATZ: How do you do that?
PAUL RYAN: So they proposed a $478 billion cut to defense to begin with. Now we have another $500 billion cut to defense that’s lurking on the horizon. They insisted upon that cut being involved in the debt negotiations, and so we have a $1 trillion cut…
RADDATZ: Let’s put the automatic defense cuts aside, OK?
PAUL RYAN: Right, OK.
RADDATZ: Let’s put those aside. No one wants that.
JOE BIDEN: I’d like to go back to that.
RADDATZ: But I want to know how you do the math and have this increase in defense spending?
JOE BIDEN: Two trillion dollars.
PAUL RYAN: You don’t cut defense by a trillion dollars. That’s what we’re talking about.
RADDATZ: And what — what national security issues justify an increase?
JOE BIDEN: Who’s cutting it by $1 trillion?
PAUL RYAN: We’re going to cut 80,000 soldiers, 20,000 Marines, 120 cargo planes. We’re going to push the Joint Strike Fighter out…
RADDATZ: Drawing down in one war and one war…
PAUL RYAN: If these cuts go through, our Navy will be the smallest — the smallest it has been since before World War I.
This invites weakness. Look, do we believe in peace through strength? You bet we do. And that means you don’t impose these devastating cuts on our military.
So we’re saying don’t cut the military by a trillion dollars. Not increase it by a trillion, don’t cut it by a trillion dollars.
RADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President Biden on this. I want to move on.
JOE BIDEN: Look, we don’t cut it. And I might add, this so-called — I know we don’t want to use the fancy word “sequester,” this automatic cut — that was part of a debt deal that they asked for.
And let me tell you what my friend said at a press conference announcing his support of the deal. He said, and I’m paraphrase, We’ve been looking for this moment for a long time.
PAUL RYAN: Can I tell you what that meant?
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: We’ve been looking for bipartisanship for a long time.
JOE BIDEN: And so the bipartisanship is what he voted for, the automatic cuts in defense if they didn’t act.
And beyond that, they asked for another — look, the military says we need a smaller, leaner Army, we need more special forces, we need — we don’t need more M1 tanks, what we need is more UAVs.
RADDATZ: Some of the military.
(CROSSTALK)
JOE BIDEN: Not some of the military. That was the decision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended to us and agreed to by the president. That is a fact.
RADDATZ: Who answers to a civilian leader.
JOE BIDEN: They made the recommendation first.
RADDATZ: OK. Let’s move on to Afghanistan.
PAUL RYAN: Can I get into that for a second?
RADDATZ: I’d like to move on to Afghanistan please. And that’s one of the biggest expenditures this country has made, in dollars, and more importantly in lives.
We just passed the sad milestone of losing 2,000 U.S. troops there in this war. More than 50 of them were killed this year by the very Afghan forces we are trying to help.
Now, we’ve reached the recruiting goal for Afghan forces, we’ve degraded Al Qaida. So tell me, why not leave now? What more can we really accomplish? Is it worth more American lives?
PAUL RYAN: We don’t want to lose the gains we’ve gotten. We want to make sure that the Taliban does not come back in and give Al Qaida a safe haven.
We agree with the administration on their 2014 transition.
Look, when I think about Afghanistan, I think about the incredible job that our troops have done. You’ve been there more than the two of us combined. First time I was there in 2002, it was amazing to me what they were facing. When I went to the Ahgandah (ph) Valley in Kandahar before the surge, I sat down with a young private in the 82nd from the Monamanee (ph) Indian reservation who would tell me what he did every day, and I was in awe. And to see what they had in front of them.
And then to go back there in December, to go throughout Helmand with the Marines, to see what they had accomplished, it’s nothing short of amazing.
What we don’t want to do is lose the gains we’ve gotten. Now, we’ve disagreed from time to time on a few issues. We would have more likely taken into accounts the recommendations from our commanders, General Petraeus, Admiral Mullen, on troop levels throughout this year’s fighting season. We’ve been skeptical about negotiations with the Taliban, especially while they’re shooting at us.
But we want to see the 2014 transition be successful, and that means we want to make sure our commanders have what they need to make sure that it is successful so that this does not once again become a launching pad for terrorists.
RADDATZ: Vice President Biden?
