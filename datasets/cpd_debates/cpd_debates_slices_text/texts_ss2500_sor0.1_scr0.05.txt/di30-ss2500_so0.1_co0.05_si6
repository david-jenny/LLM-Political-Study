DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming.
JOE BIDEN: He blew it.
DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929.
WALLACE: Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-
DONALD TRUMP: When COVID came along.
WALLACE: … when there was record low unemployment before COVID.
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, Chris, wait.
JOE BIDEN: … number one. Number two-
DONALD TRUMP: Chris.
JOE BIDEN: Number three.
DONALD TRUMP: They said it would take… No, you’re on number two.
JOE BIDEN: No.
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, Chris. They said it would take-
JOE BIDEN: This guy-
DONALD TRUMP: … a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing.
JOE BIDEN: We did not. [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: … standard fare.
JOE BIDEN: I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry.
DONALD TRUMP: He totally gave up on manufacturing.
WALLACE: All right, let him-
JOE BIDEN: I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. We brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They’re gone. He blew it. And in fact, they’re gone-
DONALD TRUMP: Ohio had the best year it’s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you. [crosstalk].
WALLACE: Vice President, go ahead.
JOE BIDEN: And so you take a look at what he’s actually done. He’s done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China’s perfected the art of the steal. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit-
DONALD TRUMP: China ate your lunch- [crosstalk].
JOE BIDEN: … with Mexico.
DONALD TRUMP: China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and, wha–, he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we’re at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave your son three and a half million dollars?
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: What did he do to deserve it? What did he do with Burisma-
JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.
DONALD TRUMP: … to deserve $183,000?
WALLACE: Sir, you’ve asked him a question, let him answer it.
JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh really, he didn’t get three and a half million?
WALLACE: President-
JOE BIDEN: Is totally-
WALLACE: President, please. You’ve asked a question- [crosstalk]
JOE BIDEN: Totally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way-
DONALD TRUMP: Well wait, he didn’t get three and a half million dollars, Joe?
JOE BIDEN: Vice-
DONALD TRUMP: He got three and a half million dollars-
WALLACE: President.
DONALD TRUMP: … dollars.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really?
WALLACE: President, it’s an open discussion. Please- [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: It’s a fact.
JOE BIDEN: It is not a fact.
WALLACE: Well, you have raised an issue, let the Vice President answer.
JOE BIDEN: It’s been totally discredited.
DONALD TRUMP: Did Burisma pay him 183 thousand a month, with no experience in energy?
WALLACE: President-
JOE BIDEN: My son did nothing wrong at Burisma-
DONALD TRUMP: I think he did.
JOE BIDEN: The only guy that. . .
WALLACE: President, let him answer. [crosstalk].
JOE BIDEN: He doesn’t want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally thoroughly discredited. . .
DONALD TRUMP: By who?
JOE BIDEN: And you can-
DONALD TRUMP: The media.
JOE BIDEN: by everybody. Well, by the media, by our allies.
DONALD TRUMP: By the media, because they refuse to talk about it-
JOE BIDEN: By the World Bank-
DONALD TRUMP: … because they’re embarrassed.
JOE BIDEN: By everyone, as discredited. And matter of fact [crosstalk] Matter of fact-
WALLACE: President, please stop.
JOE BIDEN: Even the people who testified under oath-
DONALD TRUMP: So let me ask you this, Joe- [crosstalk].
WALLACE: No, no. Go ahead, – I’m listening to you.
JOE BIDEN: Even the people under-
DONALD TRUMP: He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow.
JOE BIDEN: … testified, he testified under oath in his Administration said I did my job and I did it very well.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really?
JOE BIDEN: I did it honorably.
DONALD TRUMP: I’d like to know who they are.
JOE BIDEN: Well, I’ll give you the list of the people who-
DONALD TRUMP: I’ll fire them.
WALLACE: No, no. Go ahead, sir.
JOE BIDEN: I’m sure that you’ve already fired most of them, because they did a good job.
DONALD TRUMP: Some people don’t do a good job.
JOE BIDEN: Well, here’s the- [crosstalk]
WALLACE: Go ahead. You get the- [crosstalk] Wait a minute. You get the final word, -
JOE BIDEN: Well, it’s hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me, this person.
DONALD TRUMP: Hey, hey, let me just say, that
JOE BIDEN: No, no. President- [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: Three and a half million, Joe.
JOE BIDEN: That is simply not true.
DONALD TRUMP: Why did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow?
JOE BIDEN: Look, here’s the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don’t want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family’s already-
DONALD TRUMP: My family-
WALLACE: No, no- [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP: My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with government.
JOE BIDEN: And that’s such a- [crosstalk]
WALLACE: President-
DONALD TRUMP: Every single one of them lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with government.
JOE BIDEN: This is not about my family or his family. It’s about your family, the American people. [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: And he got three and a half million dollars for nothing.
JOE BIDEN: That’s not true. It doesn’t want to talk about what you need. You, the American people. It’s about you. That’s what we’re talking about here. [crosstalk]
WALLACE: That’s the end of the segment. We’re moving on.
JOE BIDEN: He didn’t take that.
WALLACE: Vice President-
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, can I be honest? It’s a very important question-
JOE BIDEN: Try to be honest.
WALLACE: No.
DONALD TRUMP: He stood up-
WALLACE: The answer to the question is no.
DONALD TRUMP: … and he threatened Ukraine-
WALLACE: Sir-
DONALD TRUMP: … with a billion dollars-
JOE BIDEN: That is absolutely not true.
WALLACE: Stop. [crosstalk] Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I- [crosstalk] Why should I be different than the two of you? So here’s the deal.
JOE BIDEN: That’s a good point.
WALLACE: We have six segments. We have ended that segment. We’re going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments. In those two uninterrupted minutes, President, you can say anything you want. I’m going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But we, I, I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I’m appealing to you, sir, to do that.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, and him too.
WALLACE: Well, frankly, you’ve been doing more interrupting than he has.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, that’s all right, but he does plenty.
WALLACE: Well, sir, less than-
DONALD TRUMP: He does plenty.
WALLACE: No, less than you have. Let’s please continue on. The issue of race. Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president.
