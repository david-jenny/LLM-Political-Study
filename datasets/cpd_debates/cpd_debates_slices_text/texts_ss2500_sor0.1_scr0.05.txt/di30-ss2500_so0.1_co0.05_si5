WALLACE: All right. Your time is up, sir. We are going to get to-
DONALD TRUMP: I have to respond to that.
WALLACE: Well, you both had two minutes, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, he made a statement.
WALLACE: And so did you.
DONALD TRUMP: No, people want their schools open. They don’t want to be shut down. They don’t want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It’s so sad what’s happening in New York. It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives.
JOE BIDEN: People want to be safe.
DONALD TRUMP: They’ll be careful, but they want their schools open.
JOE BIDEN: People want to be safe.
DONALD TRUMP: I’m the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I’m very happy to do it-
WALLACE: All right. Let’s-
DONALD TRUMP: … and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When [crosstalk].
WALLACE: Gentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but first, President, as you well know, there’s a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I’m asking you this specific question. Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?
DONALD TRUMP: I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-
JOE BIDEN: Show us your tax returns.
DONALD TRUMP: I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year.
JOE BIDEN: Show us your tax returns.
DONALD TRUMP: You’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company.
WALLACE: Sir, I’m asking you a specific question, which is-
DONALD TRUMP: But let me tell you-
WALLACE: I understand all of that.
JOE BIDEN: Release your tax return.
WALLACE: I understand all of that-
DONALD TRUMP: Let me-
WALLACE: No, President, I’m asking you a question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?
DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars.
WALLACE: You paid millions of dollars in-
DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars, yes.
WALLACE: So not 750?
DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars. And you’ll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it.
JOE BIDEN: When?
DONALD TRUMP: But let me just tell you-
JOE BIDEN: In [crosstalk]?
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We built the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama Administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s-
WALLACE: Vice President Biden, you want to respond?
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s okay.
JOE BIDEN: And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help.
DONALD TRUMP: But why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?
JOE BIDEN: Because you weren’t president-
DONALD TRUMP: Why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?
JOE BIDEN: Because you weren’t president and screwing things up.
DONALD TRUMP: You were a Senator and [crosstalk]-
JOE BIDEN: You’re the worst president America has ever had. Come on.
DONALD TRUMP: Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe. We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing.
WALLACE: Okay. Gentlemen?
DONALD TRUMP: Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts.
WALLACE: President, we’re talking about the economy. I’d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Vice President, your economic plan-
DONALD TRUMP: He has none.
WALLACE: … if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year.
WALLACE: … and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it’s just coming out of a recession.
JOE BIDEN: Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-
WALLACE: But respectfully, sir, I’m talking about taxes, not spending.
JOE BIDEN: By the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn’t be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.
DONALD TRUMP: Why didn’t you do it before, when you were Vice-President with Obama?
JOE BIDEN: Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal.
DONALD TRUMP: I got it done. And you know what happened?
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, you got it done-
DONALD TRUMP: Our economy boomed like it’s never boomed before.
JOE BIDEN: The economy-
WALLACE: President-
JOE BIDEN: Let me finish.
WALLACE: President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?
JOE BIDEN: Not lower tax for the American people.
WALLACE: But let me-
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me.
WALLACE: You talk about the economy booming. It turns out that in Obama’s final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency.
DONALD TRUMP: They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places. [crosstalk] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen.
JOE BIDEN: Look-
WALLACE: Vice President.
JOE BIDEN: … we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it.
DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming.
JOE BIDEN: He blew it.
DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929.
WALLACE: Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-
DONALD TRUMP: When COVID came along.
WALLACE: … when there was record low unemployment before COVID.
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, Chris, wait.
JOE BIDEN: … number one. Number two-
DONALD TRUMP: Chris.
JOE BIDEN: Number three.
DONALD TRUMP: They said it would take… No, you’re on number two.
JOE BIDEN: No.
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, Chris. They said it would take-
JOE BIDEN: This guy-
