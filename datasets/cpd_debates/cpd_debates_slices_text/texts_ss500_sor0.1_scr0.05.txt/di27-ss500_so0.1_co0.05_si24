RICHARD NIXON: ... . But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate. And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.
McGEE: Senator Kennedy.
JOHN KENNEDY: Well, Nixon uh- I’ll just give you the testimony of George Aiken – Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member – Republican member – and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 – said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet. And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat. Now I’ve seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh – not adequately fed. You can’t tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person – and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that – is adequate. You can’t tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States – and there are twenty-five million of them according to Benson – is well fed or adequately fed. I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food. And they’re not getting in many cases adequate shelter. And we ought to try to meet the problem. Secondly, Nixon has continued to state – and he stated it last week – these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh – platform would cost. They’re wholly inaccurate. I said last week I believed in a balanced budget. Unless there was a severe recession – and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars – larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States. So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.
McGEE: Morgan with a question for Senator Kennedy.
MORGAN: Senator, Saturday on television you said that you had always thought that Quemoy and Matsu were unwise places to draw our defense line in the Far East. Would you comment further on that and also ...
