DANFORTH QUAYLE: ... You may call that your plan, but everyone knows that you simply can’t get $150 billion in new taxes by raising the marginal tax rate to a top rate of 36 % and only tax those making $200,000 a year.

BRUNO: Senator Gore, you wanted to respond?
DANFORTH QUAYLE: And that’s why I think that families have to be strengthened, and you don’t strengthen the American family by raising taxes.
ALBERT GORE: I do want to respond to that.
BRUNO: Go ahead, Senator, Admiral.
ALBERT GORE: George Bush and Dan Quayle want to protect the very wealthy. That is the group that has gotten all of the tax cuts under the Bush-Quayle administration. Nobody here who is middle ...
