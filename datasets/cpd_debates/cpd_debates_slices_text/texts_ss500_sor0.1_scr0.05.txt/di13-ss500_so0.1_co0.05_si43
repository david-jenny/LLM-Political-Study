IFILL: ... with any need for additional troops by putting Iraqis into the effort.
Forty-nine percent increase in funding for elementary and secondary education under No Child Left Behind; that’s a lot of money even by Massachusetts’ standards.
IFILL: You have 30 seconds if you choose.
JOHN EDWARDS: Yes, but they didn’t fund the mandates that they put on the schools all over this country. That’s the reason 800 teachers — one of the reasons — 800 teachers have been laid off, right here in Cleveland. One-third of our public schools are failing under this administration. Half of African-Americans are dropping out of high school. Half of Hispanic-American are dropping out of high school.
John and I have — and I don’t have the time now — but we have a clear plan to improve our public schools that starts with getting our best teachers into the schools where we need them the most by creating incentives for them to go there.
IFILL: Vice President?
RICHARD CHENEY: Gwen, No Child Left Behind, they were for it; now they’re against it. They voted for it; now they’re opposed to it.
We are making significant progress there. We are closing the achievement gap. The results coming in from a number of studies show, without question, that on math and reading, that in fact our minority students, our Hispanic and African-American students are doing better, and that gap between them and the majority population is, in fact, closing.
So we are doing exactly the right thing. They’re the ones who have been for the Patriot Act and against it, for No Child Left Behind and then against it.
IFILL: Vice President, our final — I’m sorry, you have 30 seconds, Senator Edwards.
JOHN EDWARDS: Are you sure — yes, he started. Yes, 30 seconds, please, yes.
We are for accountability, and we are for high standards. John and I voted for No Child Left Behind because we thought that accountability and standards were the right thing to do.
But they make — did you figure out you were wrong?
IFILL: I did figure out I was wrong.
JOHN EDWARDS: Well, in fairness, if you feel like you need to go to him, we’ll — I’ll stop.
