ROBERT DOLE: ... discrimination. You know we’ve suffered discrimination in the disability community. There are 43 million of us. And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair. So we want to end discrimination. I think that answers itself. No discrimination in America. We’ve made that clear. And I would just say that it seems to me that that’s the way it ought to be. We shouldn’t discriminate — race, color, whatever — life-style, disability. This is America.

The future will be the greatest time in this country’s history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world.
LEHRER: All right. Now we go to the closing statement. Senator Dole, you’re first. Two minutes, sir.
ROBERT DOLE: Well, let me thank everybody here at the University and, Jim, thank you. All the people who may still be watching or viewing. This is what it’s all about. It’s not about me. It’s not about President Clinton. It’s about the process. It’s about selecting a president of the United States. So we have our differences. ...
