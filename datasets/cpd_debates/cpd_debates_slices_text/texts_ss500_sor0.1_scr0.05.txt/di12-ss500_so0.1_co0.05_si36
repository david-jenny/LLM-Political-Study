BOYD: Nothing on the World Series? Congresswoman Ferraro?
GERALDINE FERRARO: I think the vice-president’s comment about the Carter-Mondale administration really typifies this administration.

Science, technology and space offering opportunity that, to everybody, all the young ones coming up. And abroad there’s new leadership and respect. And Ronald Reagan is clearly the strong leader of the free world. And I’ll be honest with you. It’s a joy to serve with a president who does not apologize for the United States of America. Mondale, on the other hand, has one idea. Go out and tax the American people. And then he wants to repeal indexing, to wipe out the one protection ...
