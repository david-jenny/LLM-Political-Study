We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they’re well prepared to use force only when necessary.

I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just—just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very—I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.
