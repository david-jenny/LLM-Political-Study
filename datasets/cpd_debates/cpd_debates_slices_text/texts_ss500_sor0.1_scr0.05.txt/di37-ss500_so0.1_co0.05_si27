JOHN KERRY: ... in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go. We’re going to do it like you do it. The president broke the pay-as-you-go rule.
Somebody here asked the question about, “Why haven’t you vetoed something?” It’s a good question. If you care about it, why don’t you veto it?
I think John McCain called the energy bill the “No Lobbyist Left Behind” bill.
I mean, you’ve got to stand up and fight somewhere, folks.
I’m pledging I will not raise taxes; I’m giving a tax cut to the people earning less than $200,000 a year.
Now, for the people earning more than $200,000 a year, you’re going to see a rollback to the level we were at with Bill Clinton, when people made a lot of money.
And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I’m sorry, you too.

GIBSON: President, 90 seconds.
GEORGE W. BUSH: He’s just not credible when he talks about being fiscally conservative. He’s just not credible. If you look at his record in the Senate, he voted to break the caps — the spending caps — over 200 times.
And here he says he’s going to be a fiscal conservative, all of a sudden. It’s just not credible. You cannot believe it.
And of course he’s going to raise your taxes. You see, he’s proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending. And you say: Well, how are you going to pay for it? He says, well, he’s going to raise the taxes on the rich — that’s what he said — the top two brackets. That raises, he says $800 billion; we say $600 billion.
We’ve got battling green eye shades.
Somewhere in between those numbers — and so there’s a difference, what he’s promised and what he can raise.
Now, either he’s going to break all these wonderful promises he’s told you about or he’s going to raise taxes. And I suspect, given his record, he’s going to raise taxes.
Is my time up yet?
GIBSON: No, you can keep going.
