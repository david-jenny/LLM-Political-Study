MICHAEL PENCE: ... again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all. So, Senator, this — this insult-driven campaign, I mean…

TIM KAINE: Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn’t have said that.

MICHAEL PENCE: Oh…
TIM KAINE: … to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting.
MICHAEL PENCE: She apologized for saying “half.”
QUIJANO: Governor. It is his two minutes, please.
TIM KAINE: Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight? Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell? Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States? You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing.

That’s our proposal. Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship ...
