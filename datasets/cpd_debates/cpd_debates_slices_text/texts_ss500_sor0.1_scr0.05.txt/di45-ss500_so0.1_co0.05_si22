JIMMY CARTER: ... . Ford hasn’t moved on this. We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh – government uh – plants. This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world. We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about. If we continue under Ford’s policy by 1985 or ’90 we’ll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons.

Also, we’ll never be strong again overseas, unless we’re strong at home. And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month. We’ve got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago ...
