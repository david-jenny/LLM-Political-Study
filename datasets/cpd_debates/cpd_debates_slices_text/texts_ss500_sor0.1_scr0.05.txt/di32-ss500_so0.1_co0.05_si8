DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.
HILLARY CLINTON: And I have—well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again…
DONALD TRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA…

HILLARY CLINTON: … million new jobs, a balanced budget…
DONALD TRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.
HILLARY CLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we’re actually going to look at the facts.
When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.
But let’s not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I’ve said what I’m going to do. I’m going to have a special prosecutor. We’re going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we’re going to hold people accountable.
When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.

HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I’ve been a senator, Donald…
DONALD TRUMP: You haven’t done it. You haven’t done it.
HILLARY CLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state…
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me.
HILLARY CLINTON: And I have done a lot…
