MICHAEL PENCE: ... might follow from this, I — I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that — that lifetime of experience.
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton’s character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don’t think she’s trustworthy.

Why do so many Americans think Trump is simply too erratic?
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, let me — let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an ...
