ALBERT GORE: ... a foreign country were trained with our tax dollars and then their imports were subsidized coming back into the US.
When are you going to stop that program?
DANFORTH QUAYLE: We do not have any program that encourages companies to close down here and to go and invest on foreign soil. That is absolutely outrageous. Of course American businesses do have business abroad; we’ve got global competition. We want businesses to expand. Do you realize this, Senator, that every job that’s overseas there’s 3 jobs back here to support that.

ALBERT GORE: Listen, what we’re proposing —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: You know what you’re doing, you know what you’re doing? You’re pulling a Clinton.
(Laughter)
And you know what a Clinton is? And you know what Clinton is? A Clinton is, is what he says — ...
