JOHN KERRY: ... down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them.
It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.
I regret what’s happened in these past months. And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror. Putin now controls all the television stations. His political opposition is being put in jail.
And I think it’s very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good. This is a very important country to us. We want a partnership.
But we always have to stand up for democracy. As George Will said the other day, “Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now.”
Now, I’d like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks. Because that’s one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.
Just because the president says it can’t be done, that you’d lose China, doesn’t mean it can’t be done. I mean, this is the president who said “There were weapons of mass destruction,” said “Mission accomplished,” said we could fight the war on the cheap — none of which were true.
We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il. And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China. Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.
LEHRER: Thirty seconds, President.
GEORGE W. BUSH: You know my opinion on North Korea. I can’t say it any more plainly.
LEHRER: Well, but when he used the word “truth” again…
GEORGE W. BUSH: Pardon me?
LEHRER: … talking about the truth of the matter. He used the word “truth” again. Did that raise any hackles with you?
GEORGE W. BUSH: Oh, I’m a pretty calm guy. I don’t take it personally.
LEHRER: OK. All right.
GEORGE W. BUSH: You know, we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion: that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.
And I don’t hold it against him that he said grave threat. I’m not going to go around the country saying he didn’t tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.
