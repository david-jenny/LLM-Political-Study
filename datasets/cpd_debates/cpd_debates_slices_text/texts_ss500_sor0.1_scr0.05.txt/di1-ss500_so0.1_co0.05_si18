DANFORTH QUAYLE: ... Prime Minister Major or President Mitterrand, because truth and integrity are prerequisites to being president of the US.
(APPLAUSE)
ALBERT GORE: I want to respond to that, I want to respond to that. George Bush, in case you’ve forgotten, Dan, said “Read my lips — no new taxes.”
(Laughter and applause)
And you know what?
DANFORTH QUAYLE: I didn’t think I was going to hear that tonight.
ALBERT GORE: Hold on, hold on, let me finish.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Okay.
ALBERT GORE: He also said he wanted to be the environmental president; then he went on to say he wanted to be the education president. Then he said that he wouldn’t raise taxes again — no, never, ever, ever. Then the next day his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, came out and said that’s not a pledge. Then 2 weeks ago he said that after the election, if you win, then James Baker’s going to go back to be secretary of state; then a week later, in the debate a few nights ago, he said, no, after the election, if we win, James Baker is going to be in charge of domestic policy.
Which is it, Dan? Is he going to — what’s your role in this going to be?
(Laughter and applause)
BRUNO: Well, we’ll have to move on to another topic.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Let me —
BRUNO: Sorry, Vice President.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: I don’t have time to respond to that?
BRUNO: You’ll get plenty of chance to respond, so don’t worry.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Okay, you’re the moderator. I was under the assumption that when the thing is like that that you get a chance to respond.
BRUNO: Well, we ran out of time; according to the agreement, it’s time to move on. And I want to stick to the agreement.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Okay. Well, you got the last word on that, but we’ll come back to it.
