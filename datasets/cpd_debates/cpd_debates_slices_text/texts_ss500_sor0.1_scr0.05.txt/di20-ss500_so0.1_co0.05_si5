KALB: ... Soviet Union as a powerful, evil empire intent on world domination. But this year you have said, and I quote. “If they want to keep their Mickey Mouse system, that’s okay with me.” Which is it, President?

And I made it plain to them, we’re not. There’s been no change in my attitude at all.
