MODERATOR: Vice President Gore?
ALBERT GORE: It’s one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years.

I thought that’s exactly what he and Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system. It was fortunately stopped in its tracks. Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas. Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up. Our CHIPS program got ...
