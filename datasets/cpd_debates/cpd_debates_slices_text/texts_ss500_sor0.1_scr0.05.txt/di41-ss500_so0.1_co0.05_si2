WILLIAM CLINTON: ... and what will help us build a community where everybody’s got a role to play and a place at the table. Compared to four years ago, we’re clearly better off. We’ve got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit’s been reduced by 60 percent.

We should unite the white and black people and people of all cultures. Democrats and Republicans should unite also. We should all come together and think of the best ways ...
