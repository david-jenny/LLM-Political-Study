GEORGE W. BUSH: ... the technologies to do that.
That’s why I’m a big proponent of clean coal technology, to make sure we can use coal but in a clean way.
I guess you’d say I’m a good steward of the land.
The quality of the air’s cleaner since I’ve been the president. Fewer water complaints since I’ve been the president. More land being restored since I’ve been the president.
Thank you for your question.
GIBSON: Senator Kerry, minute and a half.
JOHN KERRY: Boy, to listen to that — the president, I don’t think, is living in a world of reality with respect to the environment.
Now, if you’re a Red Sox fan, that’s OK. But if you’re a president, it’s not.
Let me just say to you, number one, don’t throw the labels around. Labels don’t mean anything.
I supported welfare reform. I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America. I’ve been for faith-based initiatives helping to intervene in the lives of young children for years. I was — broke with my party in 1985, one of the first three Democrats to fight for a balanced budget when it was heresy.
Labels don’t fit, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, when it comes to the issue of the environment, this is one of the worst administrations in modern history.
The Clear Skies bill that he just talked about, it’s one of those Orwellian names you pull out of the sky, slap it onto something, like “No Child Left Behind” but you leave millions of children behind. Here they’re leaving the skies and the environment behind.
If they just left the Clean Air Act all alone the way it is today, no change, the air would be cleaner than it is if you pass the Clear Skies act. We’re going backwards.
In fact, his environmental enforcement chief air-quality person at the EPA resigned in protest over what they’re doing to what they are calling the new source performance standards for air quality.
They’re going backwards on the definition for wetlands. They’re going backwards on the water quality.
They pulled out of the global warming, declared it dead, didn’t even accept the science.
I’m going to be a president who believes in science.
GIBSON: President?
