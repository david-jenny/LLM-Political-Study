MITT ROMNEY: ... graders number one in English and also in math. First time one state had been number one in all four measures.

BARACK OBAMA: Ten years earlier…
MITT ROMNEY: And that was — that was — that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation.
BARACK OBAMA: But that was 10 years before you took office.

MITT ROMNEY: And then you cut education spending when you came into office.
MITT ROMNEY: The first — the first — the first — and we kept our schools number one in the nation. They’re still number one today.
SCHIEFFER: All right.
MITT ROMNEY: And the principles that we put in place, we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to — to be able compete, but also if they graduated the quarter of their class, they got a four-year tuition- free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning.

SCHIEFFER: But can you do this without driving deeper…
