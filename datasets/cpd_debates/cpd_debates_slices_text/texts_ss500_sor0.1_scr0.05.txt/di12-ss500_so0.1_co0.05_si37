GEORGE H. BUSH: ... to serve with a president who does not apologize for the United States of America. Mondale, on the other hand, has one idea. Go out and tax the American people.

I wouldn’t be standing here if Fritz Mondale didn’t have the courage and my party didn’t stand for the values that it does – the values of fairness and equal opportunity. Those values make our country strong and the future of this country and how strong it will be is what this election is all about. Over ...
