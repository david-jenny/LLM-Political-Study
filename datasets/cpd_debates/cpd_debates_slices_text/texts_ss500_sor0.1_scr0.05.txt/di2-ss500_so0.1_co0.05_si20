DONALD TRUMP: ... been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We’re going to cut business taxes massively. They’re going to start hiring people. We’re going to bring the $2.5 trillion…
WALLACE: Time, Trump.
DONALD TRUMP: … that’s offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because…
WALLACE: Trump?
DONALD TRUMP: … right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because…
DONALD TRUMP: You can’t.
HILLARY CLINTON: … the fact is, he’s going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we’ve ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.
I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I’m going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.
Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.
So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That’s the kind of approach that will work.
WALLACE: Secretary…
HILLARY CLINTON: Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we’ve tried that. It has not worked the way that it has been promised.
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.
DONALD TRUMP: Correct.
