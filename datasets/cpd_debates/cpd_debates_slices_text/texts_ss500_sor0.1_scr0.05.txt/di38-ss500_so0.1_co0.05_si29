MICHAEL PENCE: ... .
But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500…[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: Elaine, I want to…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO: Governor, the question was about homegrown.
MICHAEL PENCE: Yeah, and so — but first, you know, let’s make sure we’re putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program…
TIM KAINE: Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they’re dangerous.
MICHAEL PENCE: That’s not — that’s absolutely false.
TIM KAINE: That’s what the Seventh Circuit decided just — here’s the difference, Elaine.
MICHAEL PENCE: The Seventh Circuit…
TIM KAINE: We have different views on — on refugee issues and on immigration. Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous? These guys say all Mexicans are bad.
MICHAEL PENCE: That’s absolutely false.
TIM KAINE: And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they’re dangerous. Donald Trump said keep them out if they’re Muslim. Mike Pence…
MICHAEL PENCE: Absolutely…
TIM KAINE: … put a program in place to keep them out if they’re from Syria. And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan…
MICHAEL PENCE: Right. Right.
TIM KAINE: … and said it was discriminatory…
MICHAEL PENCE: And those judges — those judges said…
TIM KAINE: We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination.
QUIJANO: Governor?
MICHAEL PENCE: Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn’t any evidence yet that — that ISIS had infiltrated the United States. Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS.

TIM KAINE: But they told you there’s a right way and a wrong way to do it.
