And this strategy, and this general, they are winning. Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq.
BARACK OBAMA: That’s not true.

That’s what’s happening in Iraq, and it wasn’t a tactic.
LEHRER: Let me see…
BARACK OBAMA: Jim, Jim, this is a big…
JOHN MCCAIN: It was a strategy. And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general. And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
