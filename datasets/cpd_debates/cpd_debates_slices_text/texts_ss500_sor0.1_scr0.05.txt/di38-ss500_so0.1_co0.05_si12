TIM KAINE: OK.
MICHAEL PENCE: The only issue on taxes — Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them.
TIM KAINE: Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, “If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes.” He’s broken his first…
MICHAEL PENCE: And he will.
TIM KAINE: He’s broken his first promise. Second, he stood on the stage…
MICHAEL PENCE: He hasn’t broken his promise. He said he’s…
TIM KAINE: He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven’t been paying taxes, he said, “That makes me smart.” So it’s smart not to pay for our military? It’s smart not to pay for veterans? It’s smart not to pay for teachers? And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we’re stupid. And the last thing I’ll say is this…
MICHAEL PENCE: Senator, do you take all the deductions that you’re entitled to?
TIM KAINE: The last thing — the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is…
MICHAEL PENCE: I do.
TIM KAINE: Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president. Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he’s qualified to be president. And he’s breaking his promise.
MICHAEL PENCE: Elaine, I have to respond to this.
QUIJANO: You get very little time, 20 seconds.
MICHAEL PENCE: I’ll be — I’ll be very respectful.
QUIJANO: Governor?
MICHAEL PENCE: Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires.
TIM KAINE: But he said he would release his tax returns.
QUIJANO: All right, Gentlemen…
