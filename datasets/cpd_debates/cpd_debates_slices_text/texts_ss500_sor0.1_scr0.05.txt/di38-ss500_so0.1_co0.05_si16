TIM KAINE: ... safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, it’s safer for the communities and it’s safer for the police.
That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don’t work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model.

Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their ...
