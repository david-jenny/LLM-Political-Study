MICHAEL PENCE: Absolutely I will.
QUIJANO: Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine. And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine — God bless you for it, career public servants, that’s great — Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business.
Those tax returns that were — that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what’s called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.
TIM KAINE: But why won’t he release his tax returns?
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, we’re answering the question about — about a business thing, is he…
TIM KAINE: I do want to come back to that, but…
MICHAEL PENCE: His tax returns — his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it’s supposed to be used. And he did it brilliantly.
TIM KAINE: How do you know that? You haven’t seen his tax returns.
MICHAEL PENCE: He created a runway — because he’s created a business that’s worth billions of dollars today.
TIM KAINE: How do you know that?
MICHAEL PENCE: And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn’t pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs. And he’s paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes…
TIM KAINE: Elaine, let me talk about something.
QUIJANO: Senator, I’m going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you.
TIM KAINE: OK.
