McGEE: Levy with a question for Senator Kennedy.
LEVY: Senator, on the same subject, in the past you have emphasized the president’s responsibility as a moral leader as well as an executive on civil rights questions. What specifically might the next president do uh – in the event of an uh – an occurrence such as Little Rock or the lunch-counter sit-ins? From the standpoint of MR, JOHN KENNEDY: Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas. First, as a legislative leader.

I believe the president of the United States should indicate it. Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock. I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh – the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out.
