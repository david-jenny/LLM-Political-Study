GEORGE W. BUSH: ... an intelligence group together to figure out why.
But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat. And the world is better off without him in power.
And my opponent’s plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.
Thank you, sir.
GIBSON: Senator Kerry, a minute and a half.
JOHN KERRY: Robin, I’m going to answer your question.
I’m also going to talk — respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time.
The world is more dangerous today. The world is more dangerous today because the president didn’t make the right judgments.
Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind. He wants you to believe that because he can’t come here and tell you that he’s created new jobs for America. He’s lost jobs.
He can’t come here and tell you that he’s created health care for Americans because, what, we’ve got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them right here in Missouri.
He can’t come here and tell you that he’s left no child behind because he didn’t fund no child left behind.
So what does he do? He’s trying to attack me. He wants you to believe that I can’t be president. And he’s trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind.
Well, let me tell you straight up: I’ve never changed my mind about Iraq. I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat. I always believed he was a threat. Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president. I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary.
But I would have used that force wisely, I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.
I would have brought our allies to our side. I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission.
This president rushed to war, pushed our allies aside. And Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons. He took his eye off the ball, off of Osama bin Laden.
GIBSON: President, I do want to follow up on this one, because there were several questions from the audience along this line.
GEORGE W. BUSH: (OFF-MIKE)
