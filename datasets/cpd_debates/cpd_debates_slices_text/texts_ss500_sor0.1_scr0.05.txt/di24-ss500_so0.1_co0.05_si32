PEROT: ... that, why won’t we even let the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee see the written instructions for Ambassador Glaspie?
GEORGE H. BUSH: I’ve got reply on that. That gets to the national honor. We did not say to Saddam Hussein, Ross, you can take the northern part of Kuwait.
PEROT: Well, where are the papers?
GEORGE H. BUSH: That is absolutely absurd.
PEROT: Where are the papers?
GEORGE H. BUSH: Glaspie has testified —
(APPLAUSE)
— and Glaspie’s papers have been presented to the US Senate. Please, let’s be factual.
PEROT: If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up. And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate. They will not let them see the written instructions given to Ambassador Glaspie. And I suggest that in a free society owned by the people, the American people ought to know what we told Ambassador Glaspie to tell Saddam Hussein, because we spent a lot of money and risked lives and lost lives in that effort, and did not accomplish most of our objectives.
We got Kuwait back to the emir but he’s still not his nuclear, his chemical, his bacteriological and he’s still over there, right? I’d like to see those written instructions.
(APPLAUSE)
LEHRER: President, just to make sure that everybody knows what’s going on here, when you responded directly to Perot, you violated the rule, your rules. Now —
GEORGE H. BUSH: For which I apologize. When I make a mistake I say I’m sorry.
(Laughter.)
LEHRER: I just want to make sure everybody understands. If you all want to change the rules, we can do it.
GEORGE H. BUSH: No, I don’t. I apologize for it but that one got right to the national honor and I’m sorry. I just couldn’t let it stand.
