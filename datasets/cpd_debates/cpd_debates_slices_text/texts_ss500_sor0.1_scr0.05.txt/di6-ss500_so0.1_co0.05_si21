GEORGE W. BUSH: ... from the enemy. Everybody matters. But I think it’s worth it, Jim.
I think it’s worth it, because I think — I know in the long term a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, will set such a powerful example in a part of the world that’s desperate for freedom. It will help change the world; that we can look back and say we did our duty.
