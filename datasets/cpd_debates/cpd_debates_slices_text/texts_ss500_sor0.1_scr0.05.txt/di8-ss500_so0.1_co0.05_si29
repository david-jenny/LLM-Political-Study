IFILL: Senator, you may talk about nuclear use, if you’d like, and also about Afghanistan.
JOE BIDEN: I’ll talk about both. With Afghanistan, facts matter, Gwen.

Certainly, accounting for different conditions in that different country and conditions are certainly different. We have NATO allies helping us for one and even the geographic differences are huge but the counterinsurgency principles could work in Afghanistan. McClell ...
