GEORGE W. BUSH: ... 11th changed how America must look at the world. And since that day, our nation has been on a multi-pronged strategy to keep our country safer.

We have a duty to defeat this enemy. We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.
The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be ...
