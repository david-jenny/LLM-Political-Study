JOHN KERRY: ... women’s rights be protected? Will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards? Will a woman’s right to choose be protected?
These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law.
GIBSON: Going to go to the final two questions now, and the first one will be for Senator Kerry. And this comes from Sarah Degenhart.
DEGENHART: Senator Kerry, suppose you are speaking with a voter who believed abortion is murder and the voter asked for reassurance that his or her tax dollars would not go to support abortion, what would you say to that person?
JOHN KERRY: I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.

You’ll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies.
You’ll actually do a ...
