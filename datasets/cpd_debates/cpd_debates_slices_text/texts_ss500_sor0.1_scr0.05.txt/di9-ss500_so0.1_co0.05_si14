JIMMY CARTER: ... new mental health treatment centers. And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services.

And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter’s successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh – months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter. ...
