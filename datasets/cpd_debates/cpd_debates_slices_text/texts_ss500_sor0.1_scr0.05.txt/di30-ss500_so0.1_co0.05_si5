DONALD TRUMP: There’s nothing happening there.
JOE BIDEN: Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.
DONALD TRUMP: You don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don’t know her view.
WALLACE: Well, all right. All right. Let’s talk. We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We’ve got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V. Wade.
JOE BIDEN: All right.
WALLACE: President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s right.
WALLACE: You have spent the last week-
DONALD TRUMP: Because they want to give good healthcare.
WALLACE: If I may ask my question, sir.
JOE BIDEN: Good healthcare.
WALLACE: Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.
DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate.
WALLACE: [crosstalk] when I finish I’m going to give an opportunity-
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare.
WALLACE: That’s not a comprehensive place.
DONALD TRUMP: That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.
WALLACE: I didn’t ask, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare.
WALLACE: You’re debating him not me. Let me ask my question.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.
WALLACE: President.
DONALD TRUMP: I got rid of it. And we will protect people.
