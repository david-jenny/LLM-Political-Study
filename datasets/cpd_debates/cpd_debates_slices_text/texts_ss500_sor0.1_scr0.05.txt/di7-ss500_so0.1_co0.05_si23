JOHN KENNEDY: ... States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands. General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States.

If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country. But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it’s going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society ...
