GEORGE W. BUSH: ... made the decision he made. Because freedom took hold in that part of the world, but there’s a lot of work left to be done, however.

And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics. Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he’s still going to try to be actively involved. He is an indicted war criminal ...
