GERALDINE FERRARO: ... time, with our Marines, the gate was open. The third time, the gate was there but it had not been installed. And what was the president’s reaction?

And sometimes it’s quiet support for a friend, and so I’ll leave that one there. But let me help you with the difference, Ferraro, between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon. Iran – we were held by a foreign government. In Lebanon you had a wanton, terrorist action where the government opposed it. We went to Lebanon to give peace a chance, to stop the bombing of civilians in Beirut, to remove 13 ...
