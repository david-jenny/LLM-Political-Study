LEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly…
MITT ROMNEY: Let’s get back to Medicare.
LEHRER: … before we leave the economy…
MITT ROMNEY: Let’s get back to Medicare.
(CROSSTALK)
MITT ROMNEY: The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.
LEHRER: All right.
MITT ROMNEY: If that’s the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.
LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.
MITT ROMNEY: But my experience — my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.
LEHRER: All right. Can we — can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice — a clear choice between the two…
MITT ROMNEY: Absolutely.
LEHRER: … of you on Medicare?
MITT ROMNEY: Absolutely.
BARACK OBAMA: Absolutely.
LEHRER: All right. So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, President, is there — should there be more?
Beginning with you. This is not a new two-minute segment to start. And we’ll go for a few minutes, and then we’re going to go to health care, OK?
MITT ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can’t have a free market work if you don’t have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have — I need to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldn’t have people opening up banks in their — in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive.
LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?
MITT ROMNEY: In some places, yes. Other places, no.
LEHRER: Like where?
