BRUNO: Vice President Quayle, please.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: The president does have a commitment from Boris Yeltsin to eliminate the SS-18s. That is a commitment to —
ALBERT GORE: Is it an agreement?
DANFORTH QUAYLE: It is a commitment.
ALBERT GORE: Oh.
(Laughter)
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Let’s talk about, let’s talk about —
ALBERT GORE: Well, he said he’d —
BRUNO: Let him talk, Senator.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Lighten up here, Al.
(Laughter and applause)
BRUNO: Go ahead.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Let’s talk about getting agreements. You know, the president of the US doesn’t just negotiate with your friends in Congress; the president of the US deals on the international scene. He’s got to deal with the president of Russia, he’s got to deal with the chancellor of Germany, the prime minister of Britain, the president of France, the prime minister of Japan — he’s got to deal with a whole host of leaders around the world. And the leaders sit down and they will negotiate, and they will come to agreements with people that they trust. And this is a fundamental problem with Bill Clinton, is trust and character.
It is not the issue of how he avoided military service 20-some years ago; it’s the fact — it’s the fact that he does not tell the truth about it. He first said he didn’t get an induction notice, then we find out that he did; he said he didn’t have an ROTC slot, then we find out he did; he said he didn’t use Senator Fulbright’s office for special influence, then we find out that he did.
These are inconsistencies. Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth. And he will have a very difficult time dealing with somebody like President Yeltsin or Chancellor Kohl or Prime Minister Major or President Mitterrand, because truth and integrity are prerequisites to being president of the US.
