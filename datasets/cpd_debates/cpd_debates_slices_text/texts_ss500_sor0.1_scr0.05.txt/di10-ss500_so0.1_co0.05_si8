MICHAEL DUKAKIS: ... willing to make those tough choices. Now, we have just heard two or three times from the vice president: he’s not going to raise taxes.

You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace. You’ve got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we can’t turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations. It is, though, trying to ...
