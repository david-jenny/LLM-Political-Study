HILLARY CLINTON: ... invasion, he supported it. And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it. Google “Donald Trump Iraq.” And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.
DONALD TRUMP: Wrong.
HILLARY CLINTON: And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that. Now, why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.
But what’s really important here is to understand all the interplay. Mosul is a Sunni city. Mosul is on the border of Syria. And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and—just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing “Celebrity Apprentice,” and we brought him to justice. We need to go after the leadership.
But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul. They’ve been digging underground. They’ve been prepared to defend. It’s going to be tough fighting. But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.
This is what we have to do. I’m just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that’s how Donald thinks. You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, we don’t gain anything.
HILLARY CLINTON: He has all the conspiracy theories…[crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: Iran is taking over Iraq.
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, it’s…[crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: Iran is taking over Iraq. We don’t gain anything.
HILLARY CLINTON: This conspiracy theory, which he’s been spewing out for quite some time.
DONALD TRUMP: We would’ve gained if they did it by surprise…[crosstalk]
WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it’s an open discussion.
HILLARY CLINTON: He says…[crosstalk]
