JOE BIDEN: ... Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do. Take it away.
DONALD TRUMP: No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good.
JOE BIDEN: He doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how to do that.
DONALD TRUMP: I’ve already fixed it.
JOE BIDEN: He has never offered a plan.
DONALD TRUMP: We’ve already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good.
WALLACE: Gentlemen, you realize if you’re both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster. It’s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better.
WALLACE: I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time.
DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.
WALLACE: Please let the Vice President talk, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: Good.
JOE BIDEN: He has no plan for healthcare.
DONALD TRUMP: Of course, we do.
WALLACE: Please.
