MITT ROMNEY: ... ’s the plan that I’ve put forward.
And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or — or Senator Wyden, who’s the co-author of the bill with — with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill — Bill Clinton’s chief of staff. This is an idea that’s been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let’s see if we can’t get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.
BARACK OBAMA: Jim, if I — if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.
And private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. That’s what they do. And so you’ve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney’s proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.
And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they’re stuck.
And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that’s why they were supportive of the approach that we took.
One last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid… LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.
BARACK OBAMA: … but — but — but overall.
LEHRER: OK.
BARACK OBAMA: And so…
MITT ROMNEY: That’s — that’s a big topic. Can we — can we stay on Medicare?
BARACK OBAMA: Is that a — is that a separate topic?
(CROSSTALK)
LEHRER: Yeah, we’re going to — yeah, I want to get to it.
BARACK OBAMA: I’m sorry.
LEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly…
MITT ROMNEY: Let’s get back to Medicare.
LEHRER: … before we leave the economy…
