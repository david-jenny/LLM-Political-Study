JOHN KERRY: ... to have the best intelligence in the world to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what they’re plotting, you’ve got to have the best cooperation you’ve ever had in the world.
Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we’re not getting the best cooperation in the world today. We’ve got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now. I’m going to change that.

And there’s a lot of good people working hard. We’re doing the best we possibly can to share information. That’s why the Patriot Act was important.
The Patriot Act is vital, by the way. It’s a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other. My opponent says he hadn’t changed his position on it. No, but he’s for weakening it.
