GEORGE W. BUSH: ... , before they’re too late.
He talked about the unemployed. Absolutely we’ve got to make sure they get educated.
He talked about children whose parents don’t speak English as a first language? Absolutely we’ve got to make sure they get educated.

Five hundred thousand kids lost after-school programs because of your budget.
Now, that’s not in my gut. That’s not in my value system, and certainly not so that the wealthiest people in America can walk away with another tax cut.
