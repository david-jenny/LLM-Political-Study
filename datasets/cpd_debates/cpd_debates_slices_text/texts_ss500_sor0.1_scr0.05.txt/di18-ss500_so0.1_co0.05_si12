BARACK OBAMA: ... , it gets done. So that would be priority number one.
Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it’s making our businesses less competitive.
And, number three, we’ve got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy.
But just one point I want to make, Tom. Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records. We do need to look at our records.

As president, what sacrifices — sacrifices will you ask every American to make to help restore the American dream and to get out of the economic morass that we’re now in?
JOHN MCCAIN: Well, Fiora (ph), I’m going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate.
I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government. And we’re going to have to eliminate those that aren’t working.
I know a lot of them that aren’t working. One of them is in defense ...
