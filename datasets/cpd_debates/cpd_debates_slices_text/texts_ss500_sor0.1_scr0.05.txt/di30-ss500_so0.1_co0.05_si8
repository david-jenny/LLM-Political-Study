DONALD TRUMP: With what?
JOE BIDEN: And tonight I’m going to make sure.
DONALD TRUMP: With what?
JOE BIDEN: Because here’s the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie. I’m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he’s a liar.
DONALD TRUMP: But you agree. Joe, you’re the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class.
JOE BIDEN: God, I want to make sure-
WALLACE: President, can you let him finish, sir?
JOE BIDEN: No, he doesn’t know how to do that.
DONALD TRUMP: You’d be surprised. You’d be surprised. Go ahead, Joe.
JOE BIDEN: The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time.
DONALD TRUMP: Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto.
JOE BIDEN: There is no manifesto, number one.
WALLACE: Please let him speak, President.
JOE BIDEN: Number two.
DONALD TRUMP: He just lost the left.
JOE BIDEN: Number two.
DONALD TRUMP: You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk], they call it socialized medicine.
WALLACE: President.
JOE BIDEN: I’ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare.
DONALD TRUMP: Who is, Bernie?
JOE BIDEN: Because he, in fact, already has cost 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do. Take it away.
