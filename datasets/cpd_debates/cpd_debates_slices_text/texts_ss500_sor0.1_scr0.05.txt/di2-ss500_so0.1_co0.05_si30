HILLARY CLINTON: … we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches…
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is—this is an open discussion.
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, it is an open discussion. And you…
WALLACE: And the specific question went to pay for play. Do you want to talk about that?
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, but there is no—but there is no evidence—but there is…[crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: I think that it’s been very well…

And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what’s happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace. And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.
