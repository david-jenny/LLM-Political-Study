SCHIEFFER: ... immigration.
I’m told that at least 8,000 people cross our borders illegally every day. Some people believe this is a security issue, as you know. Some believe it’s an economic issue. Some see it as a human-rights issue.
How do you see it? And what do we need to do about it?
GEORGE W. BUSH: I see it as a serious problem. I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue.
We’re increasing the border security of the United States. We’ve got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border.

And we’ll continue to do so over the next four years. It’s a subject I’m very familiar with. After all, I was a border governor for a while.

That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren’t breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs.

See, the card, it’ll have a period of time attached to it.
It also means it takes pressure off the border. If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they’re not going to have to sneak across the border. It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job.
Now, it’s very important for our citizens to also know that I don’t believe we ought to have amnesty. I ...
