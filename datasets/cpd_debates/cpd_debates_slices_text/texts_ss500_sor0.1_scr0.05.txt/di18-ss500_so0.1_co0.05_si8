JOHN MCCAIN: ... . And they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time. We can do it.
BROKAW: Thank you, Senator McCain.
We’re going to continue over in Section F, as it turns out.
Senator Obama, this is a question from you from Theresa Finch (ph).
