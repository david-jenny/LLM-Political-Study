GIBSON: President, a minute and a half.
GEORGE W. BUSH: That answer almost made me want to scowl.
He keeps talking about, “Let the inspectors do their job.” It’s naive and dangerous to say that. That’s what the Duelfer report showed. He was deceiving the inspectors.
Secondly, of course we’ve been involved with Iran.
I fully understand the threat. And that’s why we’re doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions. We’ve been doing that.
Let me talk about North Korea.
It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea. Remember, he’s the person who’s accusing me of not acting multilaterally. He now wants to take the six-party talks we have — China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States — and undermine them by having bilateral talks.
That’s what President Clinton did. He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans. And guess what happened?
He didn’t honor the agreement. He was enriching uranium. That is a bad policy.
Of course, we’re paying attention to these. It’s a great question about Iran. That’s why in my speech to the Congress I said: There’s an “Axis of Evil,” Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and we’re paying attention to it. And we’re making progress.
GIBSON: We’re going to move on, President, with a question for you. And it comes from Daniel Farley.
 Farley?
FARLEY: President, since we continue to police the world, how do you intend to maintain our military presence without reinstituting a draft?
GEORGE W. BUSH: Yes, that’s a great question. Thanks.
I hear there’s rumors on the Internets (sic) that we’re going to have a draft. We’re not going to have a draft, period. The all- volunteer army works. It works particularly when we pay our troops well. It works when we make sure they’ve got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets.
An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st ...
