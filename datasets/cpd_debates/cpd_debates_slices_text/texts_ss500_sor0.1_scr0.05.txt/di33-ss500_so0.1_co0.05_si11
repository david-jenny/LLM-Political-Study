ROBERT DOLE: ... to me that there is a problem there, President. And I will address you as President. You didn’t do that with with President Bush in 1992.

You’ve suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago. We have a commission on campaign finance reform. They send it to Congress, and we have to ...
