SIMPSON: President, I’m getting time cues and with all due respect —
GEORGE H. BUSH: Excuse me. I don’t want to —
SIMPSON: I’m sorry.
GEORGE H. BUSH: I don’t want to —
SIMPSON: Governor Clinton.
GEORGE H. BUSH: I get wound up because I feel strongly —
SIMPSON: Yes, you do.
(Laughter)
WILLIAM CLINTON: Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight. I started doing these formats a year ago in New Hampshire and I found that we had huge crowds because all I did was let people ask questions and I tried to give very specific answers. I also had a program starting last year. I’ve been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign. Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don’t have to just go blue in the face anymore. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase. When Quayle said that all the networks said, that’s not true. He’s got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.
So I’m not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this. We’ll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again. But the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn’t believe Bush was making character an issue and they said he was the greatest quote “political chameleon” for changing his positions of all times. Now, I don’t want to get into that —
GEORGE H. BUSH: Please don’t get into the Washington Post.
WILLIAM CLINTON: Wait a minute. Let’s don’t — you don’t have to believe it. Here’s my point. I’m not interested in his character. I want to change the character of the presidency. And I’m interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Perot to do for the next 4 years. So I think you’re right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.
