DONALD TRUMP: Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy in the history of our country. And by the way, now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast.
WALLACE: We’ll get to the economy in the next segment, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: It’s going up fast. I look forward to talking about it.
WALLACE: Okay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those. Reopenings. Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools. Why, sir?
JOE BIDEN: Because he doesn’t have a plan. If I were running it, I’d know what the plan is. You’ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic-
DONALD TRUMP: Tell that to Nancy Pelosi.
JOE BIDEN: Will he just shush for a minute?
DONALD TRUMP: Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer [crosstalk] Chuck.
JOE BIDEN: Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won’t even meet with them. The Republicans won’t meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it.
DONALD TRUMP: You probably play more than I do, Joe.
WALLACE: What about this question of reopenings and the fact-
DONALD TRUMP: Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down-
JOE BIDEN: You just admitted you’d shut it down.
