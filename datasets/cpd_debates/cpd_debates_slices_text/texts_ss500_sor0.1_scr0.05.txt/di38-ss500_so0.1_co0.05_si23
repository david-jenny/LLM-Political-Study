TIM KAINE: No, I…
MICHAEL PENCE: They always say we’re going to do this, we’re going to do that, we’ll eventually get the border…[crosstalk]
TIM KAINE: … border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it.
QUIJANO: Governor, Trump has said…
MICHAEL PENCE: Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation. Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws.
