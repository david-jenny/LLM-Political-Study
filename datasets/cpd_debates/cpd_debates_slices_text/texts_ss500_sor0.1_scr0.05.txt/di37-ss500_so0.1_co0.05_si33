GEORGE W. BUSH: Let me start with how to control the cost of health care: medical liability reform, for starters, which he’s opposed.
Secondly, allow small businesses to pool together so they can share risk and buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses get to do.
Thirdly, spread what’s called health savings accounts. It’s good for small businesses, good for owners. You own your own account. You can save tax-free. You get a catastrophic plan to help you on it.
This is different from saying, “OK, let me incent you to go on the government.”
He’s talking about his plan to keep jobs here. You know he calls it an outsourcing to keep — stop outsourcing. Robert Rubin looked at his plan and said it won’t work.
The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan.

But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and that’s what I’m talking about.
But let me just address what the president just said.
Ladies and gentlemen, that’s just not true what he said. ...
