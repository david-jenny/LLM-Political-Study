JOHN KENNEDY: ... a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread. Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents.

The Democratic platform pledges to plug holes in the tax laws and refers to inequitable depletion allowance as being conspicuous loopholes. My question is, do you consider the twenty-seven and a half per cent depletion allowance inequitable, and would you ask that it be cut?
JOHN KENNEDY: Uh – McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance – different kind of minerals, including ...
