ROBERT DOLE: ... can give you all these numbers, they don’t mean a thing. If you are out of work, you have nothing to eat or you can’t have medical care, or you’re holding a crack baby in your arms right now, what do you do next?

But we’ll get the rest of that tax relief. And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I’ve laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you’ll give me a chance to build that bridge to ...
