TIM KAINE: ... Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant.
But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith. But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.
So let’s talk about abortion and choice. Let’s talk about them. We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. That’s something we trust American women to do that.
And we don’t think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.
Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history. And we have some young people in the audience who weren’t even born when Roe was decided. This is pretty important. Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.
I think you should live your moral values. But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices. And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump-Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.
MICHAEL PENCE: No, it’s really not. Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.
TIM KAINE: Then why did Donald Trump say that?
MICHAEL PENCE: We just never would.
TIM KAINE: Why did he say that?
MICHAEL PENCE: Well, look, it’s — look, he’s not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton. And so…
TIM KAINE: Well, I would admit that’s not a polished…[crosstalk]
MICHAEL PENCE: You know, things don’t always come out exactly the way he means them.
TIM KAINE: Well, can I say…
MICHAEL PENCE: But I’m telling you what the policy of our administration would be.
