DONALD TRUMP: I don’t think she said that.
JOE BIDEN: She said that.
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t think so.
JOE BIDEN: And so here, here’s the point. The point is that, that’s what he is keep trying to rile everything up. He doesn’t want to calm things down. Instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire. Constantly. At every single solitary time.
