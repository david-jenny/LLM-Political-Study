PEROT: ... go to Washington and hold hands with you and we’ll get it done. I’ll take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airlines thing straightened, because that’s important to this country. That’s kind of pathetic I have to do it — and nobody’s called me yet to come up, I might mention.
(Laughter)
LEHRER: All right, I want to bring in…
PEROT: But if they do — if they do, it’s easy to fix. If you all want the enterprise zones, why don’t we pass the dang thing and do it, right?
