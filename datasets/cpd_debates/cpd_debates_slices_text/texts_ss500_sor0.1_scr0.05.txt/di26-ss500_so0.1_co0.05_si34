DANFORTH QUAYLE: ... lected to the United States Senate when I was 33. I now have the opportunity at 41 to seek the office of the Vice Presidency.

That means we have to stand up for the American farmers and that cuts back on the regulation on American farmers. That’s a positive way to accomplish that. In addition to that, we do some of the things that I think have to be done insofar as doing a better job of procurement, particularly ...
