BARACK OBAMA: Well, I definitely think there are differences.
LEHRER: And do you — yeah.
BARACK OBAMA: The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That’s its most basic function. And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I’ve worked on and thought about every single day that I’ve been in the Oval Office.
