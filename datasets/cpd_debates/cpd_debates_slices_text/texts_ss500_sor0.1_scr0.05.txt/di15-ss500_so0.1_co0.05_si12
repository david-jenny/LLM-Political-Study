ALBERT GORE: ... in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.

But we can’t be all things to all people in the world, Jim. And I think that’s where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences. I’m worried about overcommitting our military around the world. I want to be judicious in its use. You mentioned Haiti. I wouldn ...
