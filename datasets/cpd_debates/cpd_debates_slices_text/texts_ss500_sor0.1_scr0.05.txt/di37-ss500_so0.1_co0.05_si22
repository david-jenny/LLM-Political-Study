GEORGE W. BUSH: ... .
First, the National Journal named Senator Kennedy the most liberal senator of all. And that’s saying something in that bunch. You might say that took a lot of hard work.
The reason I bring that up is because he’s proposed $2.2 trillion in new spending, and he says he going to tax the rich to close the tax gap.
He can’t. He’s going to tax everybody here to fund his programs. That’s just reality.
And what are his health programs? First, he says he’s for medical liability reform, particularly for OB/GYNs. There’s a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if he’s so much for it.
Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause a 1 percent increase. That shows a lack of understanding. Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year.
And finally, he said he’s going to have a novel health care plan. You know what it is? The federal government is going to run it.
It’s the largest increase in federal government health care ever. And it fits with his philosophy. That’s why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal.
That’s what liberals do. They create government-sponsored health care. Maybe you think that makes sense. I don’t.
Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing. It would ruin the quality of health care in America.
GIBSON: Senator Kerry, we got several questions along this line, and I’m just curious if you’d go further on what you talked about with tort reform. Would you be favoring capping awards on pain and suffering? Would you limit attorney’s fees?
JOHN KERRY: A follow-up…
GIBSON: Yes. A follow-up on this for…
JOHN KERRY: Yes, I think we should look at the punitive and we should have some limitations.
But look, what’s really important, Charlie, is the president is just trying to scare everybody here with throwing labels around. I mean, “compassionate conservative,” what does that mean? Cutting 500,000 kids from after-school programs, cutting 365,000 kids from health care, running up the biggest deficits in American history.
 President, you’re batting 0 for 2.
I mean, seriously — labels don’t mean anything. What means ...
