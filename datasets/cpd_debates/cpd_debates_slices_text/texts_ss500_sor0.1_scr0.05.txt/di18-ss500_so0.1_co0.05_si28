AUDIENCE QUESTION: ... . Senator McCain, how will all the recent economic stress affect our nation’s ability to act as a peacemaker in the world?
JOHN MCCAIN: Well, I thank you for that question, because there’s no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well. And that is one of the challenges that America faces.

Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge. He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia. And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.
We don’t have time for on-the-job training, my friends.
BROKAW: Senator Obama, the economic constraints on the U.S. military action around the world.
BARACK OBAMA: Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don’t understand. It’s true. There are some things I don’t understand.
I don’t ...
