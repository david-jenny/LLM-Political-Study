RICHARD CHENEY: ... has been very evenly divided, 50-50, then 51-49, then 49-51 the other way.
We’ll keep working at it.
I think it’s important for us to try. I believe that it is essential for us to do everything we can to garner as much support from the other side of the aisle as possible. We’ve had support — we had our keynote address at our convention was delivered by Zell Miller. So there are some Democrats who agree with our approach.
And hopefully in a second term, we’ll see an improvement along those lines.
IFILL: Senator, there’s 90 seconds.
JOHN EDWARDS: Thank you.
The president said that he would unite this country, that he was a uniter, not a divider.
Have you ever seen America more divided? Have you ever seen Washington more divided?
The reality is it is not an accident. It’s the direct result of the choices they’ve made and their efforts that have created division in America. We can do better than that in this country.
Now I want to go back to the whole issue of health care, because we touched it, but I think the American people deserve to know what we would do different.
I mean, 5 million people losing their health care — everyone who’s watching this knows health insurance premiums are through the roof.
We need to talk about what we will do that they haven’t done.
First, we’re going to make the same health care that’s available to members of Congress available to all Americans. We’re going to cover all kids.
Not only that, we’re going to bring down costs by pooling the catastrophic costs so we bring down premiums.
And we’re going to give tax breaks directly to families, save them up to $1,000 a year, and to businesses — the vice president talked about that a few minutes ago — so that they can provide health care to their employees.
And we’re also going to finally do something about the cost of prescription drugs.
They’ve blocked allowing prescription drugs into this country from Canada. We’re going to allow it.
They would not allow the government to use its negotiating power to get discounts for seniors. We’re going to allow it.
We’re also going to stand up to the drug companies and do something about these drug company ads on television which are out of control.
IFILL: You have 30 seconds to respond to that, Vice President.
