RICHARD CHENEY: ... not willing to recognize the enormous contribution the Iraqis are increasingly making to their own future.
We’ll win when they take on responsibility for governance, which they’re doing, and when the take on responsibility for their own security, which they increasingly are doing.
IFILL: New question, similar topic, because I want to circle back to a question which I’m not quite certain we got an answer to.
But I will direct it to you first, Senator Edwards.
JOHN EDWARDS: Thanks.
IFILL: It’s a question of American intelligence.
If this report that we’ve read about today is true, and if Vice President Cheney ordered it and asked about this, do you think that, in the future, that your administration or the Bush administration would have sufficient and accurate enough intelligence to be able to make decisions about where to go next?
JOHN EDWARDS: Well, let me speak, first of all, to what the vice president just said, and then I’ll answer that question.
This, unfortunately — what the vice president is telling people is inconsistent with everything they see every single day. It’s a continuation of, “Well, there’s a strong connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein.”
It’s not true. It’s a continuation of at least insinuating that there’s some connection between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein. It’s not true.
It’s saying to the American people, as the president said last Thursday, and the vice president continues to say tonight, that things are going well in Iraq, contrary to what people who have been there have seen, including Republican leaders, contrary to what everyone in America sees on their television every day — Americans being kidnapped, people being beheaded, parts of the country under the control of insurgents, even today, under the control of the insurgents.
The vice president has still not said anything about what Bremer said, about the failure to have adequate troops, the failure to be able to secure the country in the short term.
You know, remember “shock and awe”?
Look at where we are now. It is a direct result of the failure to plan, the failure to have others involved in this effort. This is not an accident.
Now, let me go back to your question.
If we want to do the things that need to be done to keep this country safe, we can’t be dragged kicking and screaming to it.
One thing that everybody does ...
