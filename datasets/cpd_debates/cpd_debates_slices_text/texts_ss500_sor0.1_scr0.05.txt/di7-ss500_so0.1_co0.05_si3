RICHARD NIXON: ... ’t enough simply to be complacent. We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead.

We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom – victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries – provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.

I’ve said that I agree with the Administration policy. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the P ...
