ROBERT DOLE: ... to us, and I appreciate that. And of course Kuwait. Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn’t even understand that. We had to get their permission. The bottom line is, we went in there alone. We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution. We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.
WILLIAM CLINTON: Senator Dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the U.N. Now I’m being criticized for not working with the U.N.

It’s ad hoc, it’s sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country’s in trouble, we’ll have a meeting.
Now, to me that’s not the strategy that I think people expect from America. ...
