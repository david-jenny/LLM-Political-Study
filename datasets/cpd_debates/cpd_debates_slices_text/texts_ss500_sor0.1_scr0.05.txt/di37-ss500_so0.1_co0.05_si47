GEORGE W. BUSH: ... as a country — been through a recession, corporate scandals, war.
And yet think about where we are: Added 1.9 million new jobs over the past 13 months. The farm income in America is high. Small businesses are flourishing. Homeownership rate is at an all-time high in America.
We’re on the move.
Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don’t increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.
And abroad, we’re at war. And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined. I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until we’re safe.
The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe. There is more work to be done.
We’ll stay on the hunt on Al Qaida. We’ll deny sanctuary to these terrorists. We’ll make sure they do not end up with weapons of mass destruction. It’s the great nexus. The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction.
But our long-term security depends on our deep faith in liberty. And we’ll continue to promote freedom around the world.
Freedom is on the march. Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president. In Iraq, we’ll be having free elections, and a free society will make this world more peaceful.
God bless.
GIBSON: President, Senator Kerry, that concludes tonight’s debate.
I want to give you a reminder that the third and final debate on issues of domestic policy will be held next Wednesday, October 13th, at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, hosted by Bob Schieffer of CBS News.
I want to thank President Bush and Senator Kerry for tonight. I want to thank these citizens of the St. Louis area who asked the questions, who gave so willingly of their time, and who took their responsibility very seriously.
Thank you also to everyone at Washington…
(APPLAUSE)
I want to thank everyone at Washington University in St. Louis for being such gracious hosts.
