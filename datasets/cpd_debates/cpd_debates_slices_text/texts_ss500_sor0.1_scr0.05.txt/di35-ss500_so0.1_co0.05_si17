PEROT: ... an adversarial relationship between government and business. Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship.

I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Bush’s labor secretary said job growth has been enormous. We’ve done it in Arkansas. Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America. We can do it. I know we can ...
