Let me tell you about a friend of mine named Mitch Philpot from Marietta, Georgia — not far from here — who Tipper and I met with his family in Johns Hopkins Hospital. Their son, Brett, was in the bed next to our son and they couldn’t pay their medical bills. They used to live in Atlanta, but they lost their house. And while they were there, both Mitch and his wife lost their jobs because they could not get unpaid leave.

DANFORTH QUAYLE: We offered incentives to small businesses. Yes or no —
ALBERT GORE: That’s a no, isn’t it?
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Was small business exempted under your proposal?
ALBERT GORE: Yes.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Yes. And that’s where the biggest problem is —
ALBERT GORE: Did you require it of anyone?
DANFORTH QUAYLE: I’m going to get back to the topic again —
ALBERT GORE: Did you require it of anyone?
