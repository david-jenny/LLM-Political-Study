BARACK OBAMA: Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. First of all, let’s talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut — Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn’t believe in a timetable.
I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable. We didn’t have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.

JOHN MCCAIN: Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama’s plan is dangerous for America.
BARACK OBAMA: That’s not the case.
JOHN MCCAIN: That’s what …
