BARACK OBAMA: ... of the world’s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world’s oil. So we can’t simply drill our way out of the problem.
What we’re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. And, you know, I’ve got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.
And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.
Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.
And so we — we — we’ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump — and, you know, winter’s coming and home heating oil — as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that’s so important.
LEHRER: We’ve got time for one more lead question segment. We’re way out of…
(CROSSTALK)
LEHRER: Quick response and then…
(CROSSTALK)
JOHN MCCAIN: No one from Arizona is against solar. And Senator Obama says he’s for nuclear, but he’s against reprocessing and he’s against storing. So…
BARACK OBAMA: That’s just not true, John. John, I’m sorry, but that’s not true.
JOHN MCCAIN: … it’s hard to get there from here. And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.
And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements. And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.
BARACK OBAMA: I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct — just to correct the record.
JOHN MCCAIN: So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing…
LEHRER: Excuse me, Senator.
BARACK OBAMA: John?
