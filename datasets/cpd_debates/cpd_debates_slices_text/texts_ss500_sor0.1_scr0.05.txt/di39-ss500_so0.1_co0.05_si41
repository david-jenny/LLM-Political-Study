JOE BIDEN: ... that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, ‘The problem with the crime bill, there’s not enough people in jail.

They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that’s what I’m going to do.

DONALD TRUMP: You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you’re going to do and you’re going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.
JOE BIDEN: We did–
DONALD TRUMP: You know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I thought you did ...
