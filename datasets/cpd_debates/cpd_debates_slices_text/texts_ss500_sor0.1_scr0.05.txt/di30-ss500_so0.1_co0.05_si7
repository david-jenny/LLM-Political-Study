WALLACE: ... . I’m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare.
JOE BIDEN: Yes.
WALLACE: And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.
JOE BIDEN: It is not.
WALLACE: If I start asking the question.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s not what your party says, by the way.
WALLACE: And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of healthcare.
JOE BIDEN: It does not. It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two.
DONALD TRUMP: Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine.
JOE BIDEN: Look, hey.
DONALD TRUMP: Are you saying you didn’t agree?
JOE BIDEN: I’m not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.
DONALD TRUMP: Not by much.
JOE BIDEN: I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.
DONALD TRUMP: Not by much.
JOE BIDEN: I’m here standing facing you, old buddy.
DONALD TRUMP: If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.
JOE BIDEN: All he knows how to do-
DONALD TRUMP: On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky.
JOE BIDEN: Look he’s the deal. I got very lucky. I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well.
DONALD TRUMP: With what?
JOE BIDEN: And tonight I’m going to make sure.
