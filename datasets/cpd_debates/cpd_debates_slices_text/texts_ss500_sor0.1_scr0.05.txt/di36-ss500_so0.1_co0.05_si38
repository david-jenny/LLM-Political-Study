GEORGE H. BUSH: ... And he will do very very well. And he has my full confidence and he’ll have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ï€s and 40Ï€s and more. So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.
My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle. Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a person’s name is a little beneath this process. And he’ll do very well when we get into the debates.
(Applause)
MICHAEL DUKAKIS: Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal. I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.
(Applause)
GEORGE H. BUSH: Just the facts.
MICHAEL DUKAKIS: But did I-did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?
GEORGE H. BUSH: No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.
MICHAEL DUKAKIS: I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency. I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned. Bush picked Dan Quayle.
I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job. And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.
LEHRER: John will ask a question of the Governor. It will be the last question and then the Vice President will have a rebuttal.
MASHEK: Well, Governor, you did select Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
MICHAEL DUKAKIS: I did indeed.
MASHEK: And you have a lot of disagreement with him on fundamental issues, including the Reagan tax cuts, aid to the rebels in Nicaragua, the death penalty, gun control. Who’s right?
(Laughter)
