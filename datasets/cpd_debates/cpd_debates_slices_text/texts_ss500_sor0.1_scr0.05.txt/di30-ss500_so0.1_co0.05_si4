JOE BIDEN: ... , in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here’s the deal. The deal is that it’s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there’s seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?
DONALD TRUMP: Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don’t tell me about this.
JOE BIDEN: I’m happy to talk about this.
DONALD TRUMP: And if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban Europe.
WALLACE: All right, gentlemen, President.
DONALD TRUMP: You would have been much later, Joe, much later.
WALLACE: President.
DONALD TRUMP: We’re talking about two million people.
JOE BIDEN: You’re not going to be able to shut him up.

DONALD TRUMP: I don’t think so.
JOE BIDEN: In the court.
DONALD TRUMP: There’s nothing happening there.
JOE BIDEN: Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.
