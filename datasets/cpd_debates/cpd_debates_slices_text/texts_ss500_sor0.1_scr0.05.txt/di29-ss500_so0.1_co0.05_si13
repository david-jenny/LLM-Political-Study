RICHARD NIXON: ... . And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.

The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?
SMITH: The next question to Senator Kennedy from Novins.

And I’m wondering how you, if you’re president in January, ...
