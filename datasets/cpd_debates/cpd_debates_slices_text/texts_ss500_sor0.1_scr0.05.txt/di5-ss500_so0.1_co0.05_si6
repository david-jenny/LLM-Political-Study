SHADEL: Vice President, your comment?
RICHARD NIXON: Yes.

SHADEL: The next question is by Drummond for Vice President Nixon.
DRUMMOND: Nixon, I would like to ask eh – one more aspect or raise another aspect of this same question. Uh – it is my understanding that President Eisenhower never advocated that Quemoy and Matsu should be defended under all circumstances as a matter of principle. I heard Secretary Dulles at a press conference in fifty-eight say that he thought that it was ...
