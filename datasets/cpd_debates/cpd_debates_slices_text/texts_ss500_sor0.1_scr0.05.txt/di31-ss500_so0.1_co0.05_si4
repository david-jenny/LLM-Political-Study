PEROT: ... , folks. There are guys that couldn’t get a job third shift in a Dairy Queen driving BMWs and Mercedes selling drugs. And these old boys are not going to quit easy.

(APPLAUSE)
We are all in this together. We ought to love one another because united teams win and divided teams lose. And if ...
