JOE BIDEN: Not true.
DONALD TRUMP: You know, that’s not true either, right?
JOE BIDEN: Not true.
DONALD TRUMP: This is, this is a 100 trillion. . .
JOE BIDEN: Simply. . . Look-
DONALD TRUMP: That’s more money than our country could make in a hundred years if it were. . .
JOE BIDEN: That is simply not the case. . .
DONALD TRUMP: It would destroy our country.
WALLACE: All right. Let me. Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, some, the president is saying, I think, some people who support the president would say, that sounds like it’s going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy.
JOE BIDEN: What it’s going to do, it’s going to create thousands and millions of jobs. Good paying jobs.
DONALD TRUMP: Hundred trillion dollars.
WALLACE: Let him finish, sir.
JOE BIDEN: He doesn’t know how to do that.
DONALD TRUMP: 100 trillion dollars.
JOE BIDEN: The fact is, it’s going to create millions of good-paying jobs. And these tax incentives to people, for people to weatherize, which he wants to get, get rid of. It’s going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we’re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, with, deal with. . . By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may go away.
DONALD TRUMP: I never said that at all.
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, you did say that.
DONALD TRUMP: They made it up.
JOE BIDEN: And here’s the deal. . .
DONALD TRUMP: You make up a lot.
