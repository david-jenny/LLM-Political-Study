JOHN KENNEDY: ... gway said – who was Chief of Staff: “To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take. To me that concept is completely repugnant.” So I stand with them. I stand with the Secretary of State, Herter, who said these islands were indefensible.

Perhaps Truman can, but I don’t think I can. I’ll just have to tell Morton that. If you’d pass that message on to him.
SHADEL: Any comment, Vice President?
RICHARD NIXON: Yes, I think so. Of course, both er – Senator Kennedy and I have felt Truman’s ire; and uh – consequently, I think he can speak with some feeling on this subject. I just do want to say one thing, however. We all have tempers; I have one; I’m sure Senator ...
