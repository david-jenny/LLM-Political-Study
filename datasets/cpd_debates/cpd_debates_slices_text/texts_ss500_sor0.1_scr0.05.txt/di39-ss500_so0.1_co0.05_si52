DONALD TRUMP: ... , Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it’s very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that.
WELKER: Vice President Biden, your response and then we’re going to have a final question for both of you.
JOE BIDEN: My response is that those people live on what they call ‘fence lines’. He doesn’t understand this. They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute. Chemical plants and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claymont, Delaware. And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is any place, including in Houston at the time. When my mom would get in the car when there were first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there’d be oil slick in the window. That’s why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn’t matter what you’re paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? And you impose restrictions on the pollutions, on the pollutants coming out of those fence line communities.
WELKER: OK, I have one final question —
DONALD TRUMP: Would he close down the oil industry — would you close down the oil industry?
JOE BIDEN: I would transition from the oil industry, yes.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, transition. That’s a big statement.
JOE BIDEN: It is a big statement because I would stop —
WELKER: Why would you do that?
JOE BIDEN: Because the oil industry pollutes, significantly — but here’s the deal —
DONALD TRUMP: I see. That’s a big statement.
JOE BIDEN: Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I’d stop giving to the oil industry — I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won’t give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to oil industry?
DONALD TRUMP: We actually do give it to solar and wind–
