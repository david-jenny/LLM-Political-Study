JOHN KENNEDY: ... freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe. We don’t know what the future’s going to bring. But I would not want anyone to elect me uh – president of the United States – or vote for me – under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected. Now, many of the programs that I’m talking about – economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources – build the strength of the United States. That’s how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period. If we’re moving ahead, if we’re providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country’s on the move, then we’re stronger, then we set a better example to the world.

We’re not able to consume what we’re able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains. And all I say is, I don’t know what the sixties will bring – except I think they will bring hard times in the uh – international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I’m confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States. And I merely say that they – if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life. I think it’s going to be difficult; but I’m confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.
McGEE: Vice President.
RICHARD NIXON: Well I think we should be no – under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties. Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less. In my opinion they’re going to be de- be greater. I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes. I hope not. I hope we can ...
