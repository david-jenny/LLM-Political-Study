JOE BIDEN: That is not peaceful protest.
DONALD TRUMP: No it’s not, but you say it is.
JOE BIDEN: I did not say it is.
WALLACE: President Trump, I’d like to continue with the issue of race. I promise we’re going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment.
DONALD TRUMP: Fine.
WALLACE: This month, your Administration, uh, directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?
DONALD TRUMP: I ended it because it’s racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it, oh it’s totally racial. [crosstalk]
WALLACE: What is radical about racial sensitivity training?
DONALD TRUMP: If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we would pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And, and really, they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It’s a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to allow that to happen.
JOE BIDEN: Nobody’s doing that.
WALLACE: Vice President Biden.
JOE BIDEN: Nobody’s doing that. He’s the racist.
DONALD TRUMP: You just don’t know.
JOE BIDEN: Here’s the deal. I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk].
