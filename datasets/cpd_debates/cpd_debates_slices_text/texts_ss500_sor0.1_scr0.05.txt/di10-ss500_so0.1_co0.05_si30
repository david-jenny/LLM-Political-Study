GEORGE H. BUSH: ... country what’s happening in the volunteer section: Americans helping America. And I want to keep it alive in child care and in other entitlements.

I’m interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country. But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just don’t believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount ...
