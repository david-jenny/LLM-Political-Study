MODERATOR: Sure. Lebanon.
ALBERT GORE: I thought that was a mistake.
MODERATOR: Grenada.
ALBERT GORE: I supported that.
MODERATOR: Panama.
ALBERT GORE: I supported that.
MODERATOR: Persian Gulf.
ALBERT GORE: Yes, I voted for it, supported it.
MODERATOR: Somalia.
ALBERT GORE: Of course, and that again — no, I think that that was ill-considered. I did support it at the time. It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.
MODERATOR: Bosnia.
ALBERT GORE: Oh, yes.
MODERATOR: Haiti.
ALBERT GORE: Yes.
MODERATOR: And then Kosovo.
ALBERT GORE: Yes.
MODERATOR: We talked about that. Want me to do it with you? Lebanon.
GEORGE W. BUSH: Make a couple comments.
MODERATOR: Sure, absolutely, sure. Somalia.
GEORGE W. BUSH: Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission, and that’s where the mission went wrong. The mission was changed. And as a result, our nation paid a price. And so I don’t think our troops ought to be used for what’s called nation-building. I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war. I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it’s in our best interests. But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti. I wouldn’t have supported either.
MODERATOR: What about Lebanon?
GEORGE W. BUSH: Yes.
MODERATOR: Grenada.
GEORGE W. BUSH: Yes.
MODERATOR: Panama?
GEORGE W. BUSH: Yes. Some of them I’ve got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean.
