RONALD REAGAN: ... But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.

I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mondale in complete agreement with what we’re doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we’ve been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group.
