GEORGE W. BUSH: ... , to discount their sacrifices. You cannot lead an alliance if you say, you know, you’re going alone. And people listen. They’re sacrificing with us.
GIBSON: Senator?
JOHN KERRY: President, countries are leaving the coalition, not joining. Eight countries have left it.
If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States.
That’s not a grand coalition.
Ninety percent of the casualties are American. Ninety percent of the costs are coming out of your pockets.
