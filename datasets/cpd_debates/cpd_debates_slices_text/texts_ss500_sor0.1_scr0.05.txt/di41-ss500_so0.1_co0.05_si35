ROBERT DOLE: ... would be willing to have another debate this year. We can invite all the candidates. And talk about the economy. If we don’t get the economy to grow, if we don’t cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, we’re going to limp into the next century.

ROBERT DOLE: Well, we have in our economic pack, — individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings. You can also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home. We’re doing that precisely, and I think one thing sooner or later we’re going to have to consider is take a look at the Social Security system. Because we’ve got a lot of people advocating we don’t want to put our money into Social Security. ...
