GERALD FORD: ... – Carter wants. Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder. You don’t negotiate with Brezhnev from weakness. And the kind of defense program that Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.
FREDERICK: Trewhitt, a question for President Ford.
TREWHITT: President, my question really is the other side of the coin from Frankel’s. For a generation the United States has had a foreign policy based on containment of Communism. Yet we have lost the first war in Vietnam; we lost a shoving match in Angola. Uh – the Communists threatened to come to power by peaceful means in Italy and relations generally have cooled with the Soviet Union in the last few months.

Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years.

The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh – influence and power in the Middle East. But let’s turn for a minute to the uhh – southern African operations that are now going ...
