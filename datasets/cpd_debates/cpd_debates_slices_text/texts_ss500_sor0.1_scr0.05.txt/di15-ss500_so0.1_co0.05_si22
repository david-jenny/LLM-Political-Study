GEORGE W. BUSH: ... being discriminated against? It becomes a tool, a corrective tool. And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning. And if they are, fine. And if they’re not, there has to be a consequence. And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education. There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.
MODERATOR: Vice President Gore, what would be on your racial discrimination elimination list as president?
ALBERT GORE: Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws. I think we still need affirmative action. I would pass a hate crimes law, as I said, and I guess I had misunderstood the governor’s previous position. The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also. But I would like to shift, if I could, to the big issue of education.
MODERATOR: Hold on one second. What is the misunderstanding? Let’s clear this up.
ALBERT GORE: Well, I had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in Texas was — failed, and that the Byrd family, among others, asked you to support it, Governor, and it died in committee for lack of support. Am I wrong about that?
GEORGE W. BUSH: Well, you don’t realize we have a hate crimes statute? We do.
ALBERT GORE: I’m talking about the one that was proposed to deal —
GEORGE W. BUSH: No — well, what the Vice President must not understand is we’ve got a hate crimes bill in Texas. And secondly, the people that murdered Byrd got the ultimate punishment. The death penalty.
MODERATOR: They were prosecuted under the murder laws, were they not, in Texas?
GEORGE W. BUSH: In this case when you murder somebody it’s hate, Jim. The crime is hate. And they got the ultimate punishment. I’m not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty. We happen to have a statute on the books that’s a hate crimes statute in Texas.
ALBERT GORE: May I respond?
