DANFORTH QUAYLE: Thank you. Talk about waffling around. This issue is a very important issue. It has been debated throughout your public life and throughout my public life, and one thing that I don’t think that it is wise to do, and that is to change your position.

DANFORTH QUAYLE: How long did he have —
ALBERT GORE: I know you want to change the subject, Dan, but let’s stay on this one for a while.
