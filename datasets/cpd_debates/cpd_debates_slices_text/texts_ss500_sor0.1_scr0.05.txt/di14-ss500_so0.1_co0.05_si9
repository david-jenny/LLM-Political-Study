JOSEPH LIEBERMAN: ... a very exciting tax credit program that I hope I’ll have a chance to talk about later, Bernie, that encourages savings by people early in life and any time in life by having the federal government match savings for the 75 million Americans who make $100,000 or less up to $2,000 a year. Very briefly, if a young couple making $50,000 a year saves $1,000, the government will put another $1,000 in that account.

They didn’t address the sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abortion in the society so much as evaluate that particular drug.
