JOE BIDEN: You just admitted you’d shut it down.
DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn’t know anything about the disease. Now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren’t, even younger people aren’t. We’ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd.
WALLACE: All right. I want to move onto another-
DONALD TRUMP: Because it’s a political thing.
WALLACE: I want to move onto another subject.
JOE BIDEN: I got to respond to that.
WALLACE: I want to move-
DONALD TRUMP: But those states-
WALLACE: Gentlemen, I want to move onto another subject.
DONALD TRUMP: Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now.
JOE BIDEN: I got to respond to that.
DONALD TRUMP: He wants to shut down the whole country.
WALLACE: President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer. And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the efficacy of masks?
DONALD TRUMP: No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-
JOE BIDEN: Just like your rally.
