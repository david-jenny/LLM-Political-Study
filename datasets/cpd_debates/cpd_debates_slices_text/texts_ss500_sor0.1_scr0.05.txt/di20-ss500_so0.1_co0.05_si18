RONALD REAGAN: ... 1 advantage over the allies in Europe. When they protested that and suggested a smaller number, perhaps, I went along with that.

What would you do instead today, if anything?
WALTER MONDALE: This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with. I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so. That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of ...
