GEORGE W. BUSH: ... the record of the man running for the president.
They don’t name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasn’t shown up to many meetings. They named him because of his votes. And it’s reality.

That’s why I proposed a hydrogen automobile — hydrogen-generated automobile. We’re spending $1 billion to come up with the technologies to do that.
That’s why I’m a big proponent of clean coal technology, to make sure we can use coal but in a clean way.
I guess you’d say I’m a good steward of the land.
