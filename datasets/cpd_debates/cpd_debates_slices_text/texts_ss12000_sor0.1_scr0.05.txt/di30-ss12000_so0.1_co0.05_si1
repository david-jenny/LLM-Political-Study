DONALD TRUMP: That’s wrong.
WALLACE: Sir, wait. No. Sir-
DONALD TRUMP: [crosstalk].
WALLACE: Yeah, I understand. You’ve agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have it.
JOE BIDEN: Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history.
JOE BIDEN: Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why doesn’t he take care of the… You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety.
JOE BIDEN: Schools. Why aren’t schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his Administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They’ve done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They’re closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely.
WALLACE: All right. Your time is up, sir. We are going to get to-
DONALD TRUMP: I have to respond to that.
WALLACE: Well, you both had two minutes, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, he made a statement.
WALLACE: And so did you.
DONALD TRUMP: No, people want their schools open. They don’t want to be shut down. They don’t want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It’s so sad what’s happening in New York. It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives.
JOE BIDEN: People want to be safe.
DONALD TRUMP: They’ll be careful, but they want their schools open.
JOE BIDEN: People want to be safe.
DONALD TRUMP: I’m the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I’m very happy to do it-
WALLACE: All right. Let’s-
DONALD TRUMP: … and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When [crosstalk].
WALLACE: Gentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but first, President, as you well know, there’s a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I’m asking you this specific question. Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?
DONALD TRUMP: I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-
JOE BIDEN: Show us your tax returns.
DONALD TRUMP: I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year.
JOE BIDEN: Show us your tax returns.
DONALD TRUMP: You’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company.
WALLACE: Sir, I’m asking you a specific question, which is-
DONALD TRUMP: But let me tell you-
WALLACE: I understand all of that.
JOE BIDEN: Release your tax return.
WALLACE: I understand all of that-
DONALD TRUMP: Let me-
WALLACE: No, President, I’m asking you a question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?
DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars.
WALLACE: You paid millions of dollars in-
DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars, yes.
WALLACE: So not 750?
DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars. And you’ll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it.
JOE BIDEN: When?
DONALD TRUMP: But let me just tell you-
JOE BIDEN: In [crosstalk]?
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We built the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama Administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s-
WALLACE: Vice President Biden, you want to respond?
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s okay.
JOE BIDEN: And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help.
DONALD TRUMP: But why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?
JOE BIDEN: Because you weren’t president-
DONALD TRUMP: Why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?
JOE BIDEN: Because you weren’t president and screwing things up.
DONALD TRUMP: You were a Senator and [crosstalk]-
JOE BIDEN: You’re the worst president America has ever had. Come on.
DONALD TRUMP: Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe. We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing.
WALLACE: Okay. Gentlemen?
DONALD TRUMP: Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts.
WALLACE: President, we’re talking about the economy. I’d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Vice President, your economic plan-
DONALD TRUMP: He has none.
WALLACE: … if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year.
WALLACE: … and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it’s just coming out of a recession.
JOE BIDEN: Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-
WALLACE: But respectfully, sir, I’m talking about taxes, not spending.
JOE BIDEN: By the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn’t be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.
DONALD TRUMP: Why didn’t you do it before, when you were Vice-President with Obama?
JOE BIDEN: Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal.
DONALD TRUMP: I got it done. And you know what happened?
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, you got it done-
DONALD TRUMP: Our economy boomed like it’s never boomed before.
JOE BIDEN: The economy-
WALLACE: President-
JOE BIDEN: Let me finish.
WALLACE: President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?
JOE BIDEN: Not lower tax for the American people.
WALLACE: But let me-
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me.
WALLACE: You talk about the economy booming. It turns out that in Obama’s final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency.
DONALD TRUMP: They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places. [crosstalk] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen.
JOE BIDEN: Look-
WALLACE: Vice President.
JOE BIDEN: … we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it.
DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming.
JOE BIDEN: He blew it.
DONALD TRUMP: It wasn’t booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929.
WALLACE: Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-
DONALD TRUMP: When COVID came along.
WALLACE: … when there was record low unemployment before COVID.
JOE BIDEN: Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, Chris, wait.
JOE BIDEN: … number one. Number two-
DONALD TRUMP: Chris.
JOE BIDEN: Number three.
DONALD TRUMP: They said it would take… No, you’re on number two.
JOE BIDEN: No.
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, Chris. They said it would take-
JOE BIDEN: This guy-
DONALD TRUMP: … a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing.
JOE BIDEN: We did not. [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: … standard fare.
JOE BIDEN: I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry.
DONALD TRUMP: He totally gave up on manufacturing.
WALLACE: All right, let him-
JOE BIDEN: I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. We brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They’re gone. He blew it. And in fact, they’re gone-
DONALD TRUMP: Ohio had the best year it’s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you. [crosstalk].
WALLACE: Vice President, go ahead.
JOE BIDEN: And so you take a look at what he’s actually done. He’s done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China’s perfected the art of the steal. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit-
DONALD TRUMP: China ate your lunch- [crosstalk].
JOE BIDEN: … with Mexico.
DONALD TRUMP: China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and, wha–, he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we’re at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave your son three and a half million dollars?
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: What did he do to deserve it? What did he do with Burisma-
JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.
DONALD TRUMP: … to deserve $183,000?
WALLACE: Sir, you’ve asked him a question, let him answer it.
JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh really, he didn’t get three and a half million?
WALLACE: President-
JOE BIDEN: Is totally-
WALLACE: President, please. You’ve asked a question- [crosstalk]
JOE BIDEN: Totally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way-
DONALD TRUMP: Well wait, he didn’t get three and a half million dollars, Joe?
JOE BIDEN: Vice-
DONALD TRUMP: He got three and a half million dollars-
WALLACE: President.
DONALD TRUMP: … dollars.
JOE BIDEN: That is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really?
WALLACE: President, it’s an open discussion. Please- [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: It’s a fact.
JOE BIDEN: It is not a fact.
WALLACE: Well, you have raised an issue, let the Vice President answer.
JOE BIDEN: It’s been totally discredited.
DONALD TRUMP: Did Burisma pay him 183 thousand a month, with no experience in energy?
WALLACE: President-
JOE BIDEN: My son did nothing wrong at Burisma-
DONALD TRUMP: I think he did.
JOE BIDEN: The only guy that. . .
WALLACE: President, let him answer. [crosstalk].
JOE BIDEN: He doesn’t want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally thoroughly discredited. . .
DONALD TRUMP: By who?
JOE BIDEN: And you can-
DONALD TRUMP: The media.
JOE BIDEN: by everybody. Well, by the media, by our allies.
DONALD TRUMP: By the media, because they refuse to talk about it-
JOE BIDEN: By the World Bank-
DONALD TRUMP: … because they’re embarrassed.
JOE BIDEN: By everyone, as discredited. And matter of fact [crosstalk] Matter of fact-
WALLACE: President, please stop.
JOE BIDEN: Even the people who testified under oath-
DONALD TRUMP: So let me ask you this, Joe- [crosstalk].
WALLACE: No, no. Go ahead, – I’m listening to you.
JOE BIDEN: Even the people under-
DONALD TRUMP: He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow.
JOE BIDEN: … testified, he testified under oath in his Administration said I did my job and I did it very well.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really?
JOE BIDEN: I did it honorably.
DONALD TRUMP: I’d like to know who they are.
JOE BIDEN: Well, I’ll give you the list of the people who-
DONALD TRUMP: I’ll fire them.
WALLACE: No, no. Go ahead, sir.
JOE BIDEN: I’m sure that you’ve already fired most of them, because they did a good job.
DONALD TRUMP: Some people don’t do a good job.
JOE BIDEN: Well, here’s the- [crosstalk]
WALLACE: Go ahead. You get the- [crosstalk] Wait a minute. You get the final word, -
JOE BIDEN: Well, it’s hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me, this person.
DONALD TRUMP: Hey, hey, let me just say, that
JOE BIDEN: No, no. President- [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: Three and a half million, Joe.
JOE BIDEN: That is simply not true.
DONALD TRUMP: Why did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow?
JOE BIDEN: Look, here’s the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don’t want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family’s already-
DONALD TRUMP: My family-
WALLACE: No, no- [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP: My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with government.
JOE BIDEN: And that’s such a- [crosstalk]
WALLACE: President-
DONALD TRUMP: Every single one of them lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with government.
JOE BIDEN: This is not about my family or his family. It’s about your family, the American people. [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: And he got three and a half million dollars for nothing.
JOE BIDEN: That’s not true. It doesn’t want to talk about what you need. You, the American people. It’s about you. That’s what we’re talking about here. [crosstalk]
WALLACE: That’s the end of the segment. We’re moving on.
JOE BIDEN: He didn’t take that.
WALLACE: Vice President-
DONALD TRUMP: Chris, can I be honest? It’s a very important question-
JOE BIDEN: Try to be honest.
WALLACE: No.
DONALD TRUMP: He stood up-
WALLACE: The answer to the question is no.
DONALD TRUMP: … and he threatened Ukraine-
WALLACE: Sir-
DONALD TRUMP: … with a billion dollars-
JOE BIDEN: That is absolutely not true.
WALLACE: Stop. [crosstalk] Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I- [crosstalk] Why should I be different than the two of you? So here’s the deal.
JOE BIDEN: That’s a good point.
WALLACE: We have six segments. We have ended that segment. We’re going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments. In those two uninterrupted minutes, President, you can say anything you want. I’m going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But we, I, I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I’m appealing to you, sir, to do that.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, and him too.
WALLACE: Well, frankly, you’ve been doing more interrupting than he has.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, that’s all right, but he does plenty.
WALLACE: Well, sir, less than-
DONALD TRUMP: He does plenty.
WALLACE: No, less than you have. Let’s please continue on. The issue of race. Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh yeah, sure.
WALLACE: President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.
DONALD TRUMP: That’s true.
WALLACE: My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first.
JOE BIDEN: It’s about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It’s about the Constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require, acquire equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people. . . Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, spewing–just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed, and they asked the president what he thought. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that. [crosstalk].
WALLACE: It is his-
JOE BIDEN: Now-
WALLACE: … two minutes sir.
JOE BIDEN: … second point I’d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said “All he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all.” This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racist hatred, racist division.
This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn’t do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man, this man is a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man’s done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he’s talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community.
DONALD TRUMP: So-
WALLACE: President Trump, you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal with race issues?
DONALD TRUMP: You did a crime bill, 1994, where you called them super-predators. African-Americans are super-predators and they’ve never forgotten it. They’ve never forgotten it.
JOE BIDEN: I’ve never said-
WALLACE: No, no, sir. It’s his two minutes.
DONALD TRUMP: So you did that, and they call you super-predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990–and that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super-predators, and you’ve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned, and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200–250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.”
I don’t think you have any law enforcement. You can’t even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe? Why don’t you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If they called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won’t do it, because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don’t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order. And I’ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it.
WALLACE: All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, “Whether justice could be equally applied in America.” Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?
JOE BIDEN: Yes, there is. There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us. But there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I’m going to do as President of the United States is call a, a, together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we’re going to work this out.
We’re going to work this out. So we change the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don’t like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when–and by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.
WALLACE: All right, -
DONALD TRUMP: What is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town-
WALLACE: President Trump-
DONALD TRUMP: … and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- [crosstalk].
JOE BIDEN: That is not peaceful protest.
DONALD TRUMP: No it’s not, but you say it is.
JOE BIDEN: I did not say it is.
WALLACE: President Trump, I’d like to continue with the issue of race. I promise we’re going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment.
DONALD TRUMP: Fine.
WALLACE: This month, your Administration, uh, directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?
DONALD TRUMP: I ended it because it’s racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it, oh it’s totally racial. [crosstalk]
WALLACE: What is radical about racial sensitivity training?
DONALD TRUMP: If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we would pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And, and really, they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It’s a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to allow that to happen.
JOE BIDEN: Nobody’s doing that.
WALLACE: Vice President Biden.
JOE BIDEN: Nobody’s doing that. He’s the racist.
DONALD TRUMP: You just don’t know.
JOE BIDEN: Here’s the deal. I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP: You don’t know.
WALLACE: Let him finish.
JOE BIDEN: The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, uh, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It’s important that people know. Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings. But it’s amazing, it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a self-sense, a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and, and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, and grew up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They look down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re gonna bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on, and we can defeat racism in America.
WALLACE: Vice President… I mean, President Trump, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: During the Obama-Biden Administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at, uh, Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very…many places. Look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened a . . . Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now.
JOE BIDEN: Oh my Lord.
DONALD TRUMP: But the reason-
JOE BIDEN: This is ridiculous.
DONALD TRUMP: … is that the Democrats that run these cities-
JOE BIDEN: Absolutely ridiculous.
DONALD TRUMP: … don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order.
JOE BIDEN: Violent crime. . .
DONALD TRUMP: And you still haven’t mentioned.
JOE BIDEN: Violent crime. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order?
JOE BIDEN: I’m in favor of law. You follow a little bit of order- [crosstalk].
DONALD TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? [crosstalk]
JOE BIDEN: Yes I’m in favor of. . .
WALLACE: You asked a question, let him finish. [crosstalk] Let him answer.
JOE BIDEN: Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly.
DONALD TRUMP: Okay.
JOE BIDEN: And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17 percent, 15 percent in our Administration. It’s gone up on his watch.
WALLACE: Okay.
DONALD TRUMP: It went down much more in ours.
WALLACE: All right, we’re done- [crosstalk] President, you’re going to be very happy because we’re now going to talk about law and order.
DONALD TRUMP: The places we had trouble were Democratic-run cities. . .
WALLACE: That’s exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on Democratic mayors and Democratic governors. But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican-led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?
DONALD TRUMP: I think it’s a party issue. You can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where, uh, 53 people were shot and eight died. Shot. If you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100, 150, 200 percent, uh, crime, it is crazy what’s going on . . .
JOE BIDEN: Republican cities, republican cities.
DONALD TRUMP: . . . and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with. But if he ever got to run this country, and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have. . .
JOE BIDEN: By the way. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . . our suburbs would be gone. By the way, our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before.
JOE BIDEN: He wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn. He was, he was. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I know suburbs so much better than you.
WALLACE: Gentlemen wait a minute.
JOE BIDEN: I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There’s as many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past. What’s, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They’re dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That’s why the suburbs are in trouble.
WALLACE: I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support?
JOE BIDEN: It means. . .
WALLACE: . . . If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call uh, for uh, community control of policing?
JOE BIDEN: Look, what I support is the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding, in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before, where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up. It went down. And so we have to be engaged with . . .
DONALD TRUMP: That’s not what they are talking about, Chris. That’s not what it . . . He’s talking about defunding the police.
JOE BIDEN: That’s exactly. . . that is not true.
DONALD TRUMP: He doesn’t have any law support. He has no law enforcement support.
DONALD TRUMP: Almost nothing.
JOE BIDEN: That’s not true. That’s not. . . Oh, look. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really, who do you have? Name one group that supports you. Name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think. We have time.
JOE BIDEN: We don’t have time to do anything except . . .
DONALD TRUMP: No, no. Think about it. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you.
JOE BIDEN: Folks, folks. . .
WALLACE: Now, gentleman. I think I’m going to take back the moderator’s role. . .
DONALD TRUMP: There aren’t any. I don’t think there are any.
WALLACE: . . . and I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent. In Portland, Oregon, especially we had a, more than a hundred straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Vice-President you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have, though, is as the Democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, “Hey, you gotta stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you’d stop the days and months of violence in Portland.”
JOE BIDEN: I don’t hold public office, now. I am a former Vice-President. I’ve made it clear. I’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted, and anyone who commits it should be prosecuted.
WALLACE: But you’ve never called for the people…
DONALD TRUMP: He’s never done that.
WALLACE: Excuse me, sir. You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call and bring in the National Guard and knock off a 100 days of riots.
JOE BIDEN: They can in fact take care of it if he’d just stay out of the way.
DONALD TRUMP: Oh really? Oh really?
WALLACE: Let, let’s just. . .
DONALD TRUMP: I sent in the US Marshals. . .
JOE BIDEN: Here, here’s the thing. . .
WALLACE: I asked a question. . .
DONALD TRUMP: . . .to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street, they shot him. For three days Portland didn’t do anything.
WALLACE: President Trump. President Trump. President Trump. . . I interrupted. President Trump.
DONALD TRUMP: I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business.
WALLACE: Go ahead sir.
JOE BIDEN: And by the way his own former spokesperson said, you know, “Riots and chaos and violence help his cause.” That’s what this is all about.
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t know who said that.
JOE BIDEN: I do.
DONALD TRUMP: Who?
JOE BIDEN: I think it–Kellyanne Conway.
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t think she said that.
JOE BIDEN: She said that.
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t think so.
JOE BIDEN: And so here, here’s the point. The point is that, that’s what he is keep trying to rile everything up. He doesn’t want to calm things down. Instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire. Constantly. At every single solitary time.
WALLACE: Okay. And, and, and to end this, button up this segment, I’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly…
DONALD TRUMP: You mean, I have to answer his stuff?
WALLACE: You have repeatedly…
DONALD TRUMP: His statement?
WALLACE: You have repeatedly. . . No. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Wait a second, you made a statement.
WALLACE: No, you’ve been talking back and forth. I’m asking you.
DONALD TRUMP: I would love to end it. I would love to end it.
WALLACE: I would love to know sir. . . You know sir if you want to switch seats
DONALD TRUMP: . . . we could, very quickly
WALLACE: . . . we can do that.
DONALD TRUMP: I’ll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That’d be no problem. But they don’t want to accept the National Guard.
WALLACE: You have repeatedly criticized the Vice-President for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left-wing extremist groups. But are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland.
DONALD TRUMP: Sure, I’m willing to do that.
WALLACE: Are you prepared specifically to do it. Well go ahead, sir.
DONALD TRUMP: I would say almost everything I see is from the left-wing not from the right wing.
WALLACE: So what are you, what are you saying?
DONALD TRUMP: I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.
WALLACE: Well, do it, sir.
JOE BIDEN: Say it. Do it. Say it.
DONALD TRUMP: You want to call them? What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who would you like me to condemn.
WALLACE: White supremacists and racists.
JOE BIDEN: Proud Boys.
WALLACE: White supremacists and white militias.
JOE BIDEN: Proud Boys.
DONALD TRUMP: Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you what: somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left-wing. This is a left-wing problem. . .
JOE BIDEN: He’s own FBI Director said unlike white supremacists. . .
DONALD TRUMP: This is a left-wing problem.
JOE BIDEN: Antifa is an idea not an organization. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Oh you gotta be kidding.
JOE BIDEN: … not a militia. That’s what his FBI Director said.
DONALD TRUMP: Well, then you know what, he’s wrong.
WALLACE: Gentlemen, gentlemen. No, no, no, we’re done, sir. Moving onto the next… [crosstalk]
DONALD TRUMP: . . . when a bat hits you over the head, that’s not an idea. Antifa is bad.
JOE BIDEN: Everybody in your Administration. . .
DONALD TRUMP: Antifa is bad.
JOE BIDEN: Everybody in your Administration tells you the truth, has a bad idea. You have no idea . . . .
DONALD TRUMP: You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group.
WALLACE: All right, gentlemen we’re now moving onto the Trump and Biden records.
DONALD TRUMP: And you ought to be careful of them, they’ll overthrow you.
WALLACE: I’m going to ask a question. When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but Vice-President Biden, you like to quote one of your dad’s sayings, which is don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I’m going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent? In this segment, President Trump you’ll go first, two minutes.
DONALD TRUMP: Because there has never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you saw what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had to fight, both flanks and behind me and above, there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done. The greatest, before COVID came in, the greatest economy in history, lowest employ–unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going.
And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling, and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we’re building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him. Three hundred and eight thousand people died because they didn’t have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we’ve rebuilt our military.
The job that we’ve done. . . and, and I’ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important. By the end of the first term, I’ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300, and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices. That is a record the likes of which very few people. . . and you know, one of the reasons I’ll have so many judges? Because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill.
When you leave office, you don’t leave any judges. That’s like, you just don’t do that. They left 128 openings, and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I’d say, if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president. You can’t be a good Vice President but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it’ll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It’s a record.
WALLACE: Looking at both of your records. Why should voters elect you President as opposed to President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.
JOE BIDEN: Under this President, we become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided and more violent. When I was Vice President, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy, and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I’ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff. He’s Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.
DONALD TRUMP: Your son got three and a half million dollars.
WALLACE: No, no, no!
JOE BIDEN: By the way, my son…
WALLACE: Wait a minute. President, your campaign agreed to both sides would get two-minute answers, uninterrupted. Well, your, your side agreed to it, and why don’t you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. Okay, sir?
JOE BIDEN: He never keeps his word.
DONALD TRUMP: Can I answer. . .
WALLACE: No! That was a rhetorical question.
JOE BIDEN: Can you add back 30 seconds?
WALLACE: Yes. You may have,
JOE BIDEN: All right.
WALLACE: go ahead.
JOE BIDEN: So thirdly, we’re poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over three to four hundred billion dollars more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less. You’re in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He’s President of the United States. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided, the nation, it can’t stay divided. We can’t be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being, and, and, and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got, he got the Bronze Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot and the people left behind, there, were heroes.
DONALD TRUMP: Really?
JOE BIDEN: And I resent-
DONALD TRUMP: Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter.
JOE BIDEN: I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden, you’re talking about Hunter?
DONALD TRUMP: I don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged. . .
JOE BIDEN: That’s not true he wasn’t dishonorably discharged.
DONALD TRUMP: . . .for cocaine use. And he didn’t have a job until you became Vice-President. Once you became Vice-President
JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.
