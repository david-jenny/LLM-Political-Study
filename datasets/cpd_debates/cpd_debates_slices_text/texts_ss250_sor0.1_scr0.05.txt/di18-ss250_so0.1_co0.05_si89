JOHN MCCAIN: ... out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.
That’s what America’s all about. I believe in this country. I believe in its future. I believe in its greatness. It’s been my great honor to serve it for many, many years.
And I’m asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I’ll rest on my record, but I’ll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.
Thank you, Tom.
BROKAW: Thank you very much, Senator McCain.
That concludes tonight’s debate from here in Nashville. We want to thank our hosts here at Belmont University in Nashville and the Commission on Presidential Debates. And you’re in my way of my script there, if you will move.
(APPLAUSE)
In addition to everything else, there is one more presidential debate on Wednesday, October 15, at Hofstra University in New York, moderated by my friend, Bob Schieffer of “CBS News.”
Thank you, Senator McCain. Thank you, Senator Obama. Good night, everyone, from Nashville.
