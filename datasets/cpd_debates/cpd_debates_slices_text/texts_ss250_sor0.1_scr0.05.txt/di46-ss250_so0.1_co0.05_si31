ALBERT GORE: ... And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade. It’s very clear to me. I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.
MODERATOR: Is the vice president right? Is that a code word for overturning Roe v. Wade?
GEORGE W. BUSH: It sounds like the vice presidentâ€™s not right very many times tonight. I just told you the criteria on which I’ll appoint judges. I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas. That’s what a governor gets to do. A governor gets to name supreme court judges. He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan. I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.
MODERATOR: Reverse the question. What code phrases should we read by what you said about what kind of people you would appoint?
