And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.
Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up—you deny this—why would they all make up these stories?
And, since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse. Trump, you go first.
