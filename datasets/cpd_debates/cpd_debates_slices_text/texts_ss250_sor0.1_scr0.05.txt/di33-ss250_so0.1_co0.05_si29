ROBERT DOLE: ... and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this. I mean, you say we’ve done all these bad things, which isn’t the case. But it seems to me the record is clear. The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor. Drug use doubled. You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment. But here you cut the drug czar’s office 83 percent. You cut interdiction substantially. I mean that’s what, I want to stop it from coming across the border. And in my administration, we’re going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border. This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world. And we have a responsibility. You had a surgeon — or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs. Is that the kind of leadership we need? And I won’t comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs. But it seems to me the kids ought to — if they’ve started, they ought to stop and just don’t do it.
LEHRER: President.
