ALBERT GORE: That’s not true —
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Foreign aid — well, Senator, it’s in your book. On page 304 —
ALBERT GORE: No, it’s not.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: It is there.
(APPLAUSE)
It is in your book. You know, Hal, I wanted to bring the Gore book tonight, because I figured he was going to pull a Bill Clinton on me and he has. Because he’s going to disavow what’s in his book. It’s in your book —
ALBERT GORE: No.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: It comes out to $100 billion of foreign aid for environmental projects.
BRUNO: All right. Let’s give him a chance to answer.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Now, how are we going to pay for it? How are we going to pay for an extra $100 billion of the taxpayers’ money for this?
ALBERT GORE: Dan, I appreciate you reading my book very much, but you’ve got it wrong.
