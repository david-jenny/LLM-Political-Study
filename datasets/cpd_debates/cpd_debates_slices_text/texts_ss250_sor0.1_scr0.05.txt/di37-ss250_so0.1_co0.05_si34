GEORGE W. BUSH: ... way. It’s a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other. My opponent says he hadn’t changed his position on it. No, but he’s for weakening it.
I don’t think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really don’t.
First of all, I don’t think he can succeed in Iraq. And if Iraq were to fail, it’d be a haven for terrorists, and there would be money and the world would be much more dangerous.
I don’t see how you can win in Iraq if you don’t believe we should be there in the first place. I don’t see how you can lead troops if you say it’s the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.
I don’t see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place.
This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support.
