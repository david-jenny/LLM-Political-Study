NEWMAN: President Reagan, your rebuttal.
RONALD REAGAN: Well, the invasion of Afghanistan didn’t take place on our watch. I have described what has happened in Iran, and we weren’t here then either. I don’t think that our record of human rights can be assailed. I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world.
 Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy. And I was glad to hear him say that, because that’s what we’ve been doing ever since I announced to the British Parliament that I thought we should do this.
Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, “Whoops, we didn’t know the gun was loaded,” and you have another totalitarian power on your hands.
NEWMAN: In this segment, because of the pressure of time, there will be no rebuttals, and there will be no followup questions. Trewhitt, your question to President Reagan.
 Trewhitt. One question to each candidate?
