GEORGE W. BUSH: ... work to make sure health care is available and affordable.
Over the next four years, we’ll continue to rally the armies of compassion, to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our country’s neighborhoods.
I’m optimistic that we’ll win the war on terror, but I understand it requires firm resolve and clear purpose. We must never waver in the face of this enemy that — these ideologues of hate.
And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we’ll also spread freedom and liberty. We got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies, to convert a hostile world to a peaceful world.
My hope for America is a prosperous America, a hopeful America and a safer world.
I want to thank you for listening tonight.
I’m asking for your vote.
God bless you.
SCHIEFFER: Thank you, President.
Thank you, Senator Kerry.
Well, that brings these debates to a close, but the campaign goes on.
I want to wish both of you the very best of luck between now and Election Day.
That’s it for us from Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. I’m Bob Schieffer at CBS News.
Goodnight, everyone.
