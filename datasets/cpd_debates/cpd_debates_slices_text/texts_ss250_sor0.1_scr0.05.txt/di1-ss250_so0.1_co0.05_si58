ALBERT GORE: We’re fixing to limit one.
(Laughter)
DANFORTH QUAYLE: It’s not going to be mine; it’s going to be people like you and Kennedy and Metzenbaum and George Mitchell and the rest of that Democratic Congress on Capitol Hill — that’s who we’re talking about.
(APPLAUSE)
And that’s who the American people — as you well know, you’ve got term limits for a president, you don’t have term limits for Congress, and I think it’s absolutely ridiculous that we don’t.
ALBERT GORE: I want to respond to some of this.
DANFORTH QUAYLE: Here goes Bill Clinton again: he says, well, term limits, that’s an interesting idea, I think I might be in favor of that. Then his Democratic friends in Congress say, no, Bill, you can’t be for that.
Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth. You have to tell the truth.
ALBERT GORE: I want to respond, if I might.
BRUNO: Go ahead, Senator, quickly.
