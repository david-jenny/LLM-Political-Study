MODERATOR: Let me ask you both this and we’ll move on on the subject. As a practical matter, both of you want to bring prescription drugs to seniors, correct?
ALBERT GORE: Correct.
GEORGE W. BUSH: Correct.
ALBERT GORE: The difference is I want to bring it to 100% and he wants to bring it to 5%.
GEORGE W. BUSH: That’s totally false for him to stand up here and say that. Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear. They have had their chance to get something done. I’m going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system. All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, we’ll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.
ALBERT GORE: Let me call your attention to the key word there. He said all poor seniors.
GEORGE W. BUSH: Wait a minute. All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.
