RICHARD CHENEY: ... slam dunk. The fact of the matter is that it is regulated by the states. I think different states are likely to come to different conclusions, and that’s appropriate. I don’t think there should necessarily be a federal policy in this area. I try to be open minded about it as much as I can and tolerant of those relationships. And like Joe, I’m also wrestling with the extent to which there ought to be legal sanction of those relationships. I think we ought to do everything we can to tolerate and accommodate whatever kind of relationships people want to enter into.
MODERATOR: It occurs to me your moderator has committed a boo-boo. I asked the racial profiling question of you and you responded and then I asked the sexual orientation question of you. I should not have done that in terms of rotation. Gentlemen, I apologize.
JOSEPH LIEBERMAN: We forgive you.
MODERATOR: Thank you.
JOSEPH LIEBERMAN: You’re human, like we are.
MODERATOR: Secretary. Vice President of the United States of America, what would you bring to the job that you’re opponent wouldn’t?
