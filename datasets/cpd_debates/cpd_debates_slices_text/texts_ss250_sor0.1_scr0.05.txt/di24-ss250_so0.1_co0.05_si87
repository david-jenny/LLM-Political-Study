GEORGE H. BUSH: ... to the failed policies of the past, when you had a Democratic president and a spendthrift Democratic Congress.
(APPLAUSE)
LEHRER: Perot.
WILLIAM CLINTON: Jim, you permitted Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country. What about the honor of my state? We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden. And the difference between Arkansas and the US is that we’re going in the right direction and this country’s going in the wrong direction. And I have to defend the honor of my state.
(APPLAUSE)
LEHRER: We’ve got a wash, according to my calculation. We have a wash. And we go to Perot for one minute. In other words, it’s a violation of the rule, that’s what I meant, Perot.
PEROT: So I’m the only one that’s untarnished at this point?
LEHRER: That’s right. You’re clear.
(Laughter and applause)
