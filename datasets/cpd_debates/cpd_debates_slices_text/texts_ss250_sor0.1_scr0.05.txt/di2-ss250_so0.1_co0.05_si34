WALLACE: We’re going to—no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy. And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.
WALLACE: We’re going to drill down into this a little bit more. But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent’s plan will not. In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.
