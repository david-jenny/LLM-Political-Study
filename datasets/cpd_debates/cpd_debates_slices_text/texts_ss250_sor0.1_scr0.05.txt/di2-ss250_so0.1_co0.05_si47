HILLARY CLINTON: ... in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel. So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.
WALLACE: Trump?

WALLACE: Secretary Clinton? Go ahead, Trump.
DONALD TRUMP: I ask a simple question. She’s been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn’t you do it over the last 15, 20 years?
HILLARY CLINTON: No, I voted.
