ALBERT GORE: Yes.
MODERATOR: We talked about that. Want me to do it with you? Lebanon.
GEORGE W. BUSH: Make a couple comments.
MODERATOR: Sure, absolutely, sure. Somalia.
GEORGE W. BUSH: Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission, and that’s where the mission went wrong. The mission was changed. And as a result, our nation paid a price. And so I don’t think our troops ought to be used for what’s called nation-building. I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war. I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it’s in our best interests. But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti. I wouldn’t have supported either.
MODERATOR: What about Lebanon?
GEORGE W. BUSH: Yes.
MODERATOR: Grenada.
GEORGE W. BUSH: Yes.
MODERATOR: Panama?
