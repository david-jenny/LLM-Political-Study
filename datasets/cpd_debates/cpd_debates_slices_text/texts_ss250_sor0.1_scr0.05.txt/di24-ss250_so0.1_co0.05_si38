WILLIAM CLINTON: ... about Americans and their problems and their promise, and I think we ought to get back to that.
I’ll be glad to answer any question you have, but this election ought to be about the American people.

LEHRER: Perot.
PEROT: Is there an equal time rule tonight?
GEORGE H. BUSH: Yes.
PEROT: Or do you just keep lunging in at will? I thought we were going to have equal time, but maybe I just have to interrupt the other 2. Is that the way it works?
LEHRER: No, it’s — Perot, you’re doing fine. Go ahead. Whatever you want to say, say it.
PEROT: Now that we’ve talked all around the problem about free trade, let’s go again to the center of the bull’s- eye.
LEHRER: Wait a minute. I was going to ask — I thought you wanted to respond to what we’re talking about.
PEROT: I do, I do.
LEHRER: All right.
