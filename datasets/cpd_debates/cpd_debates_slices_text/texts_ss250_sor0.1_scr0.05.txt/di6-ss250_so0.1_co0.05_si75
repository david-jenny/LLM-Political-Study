JOHN KERRY: ... 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia.
I’m going to do it in four years, and I’m going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.
LEHRER: Your response to that?
GEORGE W. BUSH: Again, I can’t tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea. It’s precisely what Kim Jong Il wants. It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate. It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons. It’s a big mistake to do that.
We must have China’s leverage on Kim Jong Il, besides ourselves.
And if you enter bilateral talks, they’ll be happy to walk away from the table. I don’t think that’ll work.
LEHRER: All right. President, this is the last question. And two minutes. It’s a new subject — new question, and it has to do with President Putin and Russia. Did you misjudge him or are you — do you feel that what he is doing in the name of antiterrorism by changing some democratic processes is OK?
