LEVY: ... ly, I believe in the case of Little Rock. I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh – the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out. I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so. But it wou- uh – evidently uh – under the handling of the case it was not. I would hope an incident like that would not happen. I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned – with deliberate speed – then in my judgment, providing he’s behind action, I believe we can make uh – progress. Now the present Administration – the President – has said – never indicated what he thought of the 1954 decision. Unless the president speaks, then of course uh – the country doesn’t speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: “The pre – uh – the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership.” And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.
