JOHN KERRY: ... in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go. We’re going to do it like you do it. The president broke the pay-as-you-go rule.
Somebody here asked the question about, “Why haven’t you vetoed something?” It’s a good question. If you care about it, why don’t you veto it?
I think John McCain called the energy bill the “No Lobbyist Left Behind” bill.
I mean, you’ve got to stand up and fight somewhere, folks.
I’m pledging I will not raise taxes; I’m giving a tax cut to the people earning less than $200,000 a year.
Now, for the people earning more than $200,000 a year, you’re going to see a rollback to the level we were at with Bill Clinton, when people made a lot of money.
And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I’m sorry, you too.
(LAUGHTER)
GIBSON: President, 90 seconds.
