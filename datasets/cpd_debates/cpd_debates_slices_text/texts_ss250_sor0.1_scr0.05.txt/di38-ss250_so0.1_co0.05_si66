MICHAEL PENCE: … they’d be court martialed.
TIM KAINE: That is absolutely false and you know that.
MICHAEL PENCE: Absolutely true.
TIM KAINE: And you know that, Governor.
QUIJANO: Governor…
MICHAEL PENCE: It’s absolutely true.
QUIJANO: Gentlemen, please.
TIM KAINE: Because the FBI did an investigation.
QUIJANO: Gentlemen.
TIM KAINE: And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further. Sorry.
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please.
TIM KAINE: Syria.
QUIJANO: I want to turn now to Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria. Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries. Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence?
