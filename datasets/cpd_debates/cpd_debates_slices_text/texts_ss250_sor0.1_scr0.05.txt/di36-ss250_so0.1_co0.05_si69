MICHAEL DUKAKIS: ... ’re working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.
Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions. That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.
LEHRER: Vice President?
GEORGE H. BUSH: I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government. It is the best anti-terrorist report written. Yes, we shouldn’t trade arms for hostages. But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism. Now, it’s fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya. And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.
MICHAEL DUKAKIS: That’s not true. That’s not true.
GEORGE H. BUSH: And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.
