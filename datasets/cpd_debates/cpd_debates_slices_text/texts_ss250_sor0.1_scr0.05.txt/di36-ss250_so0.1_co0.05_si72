GEORGE H. BUSH: ... Bostonians don’t like it, but the rest of the country will understand.
(Applause)
GEORGE H. BUSH: Now we have a chance. Now we have a chance. And, so, I think that I’d leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record. And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega. Now, I’ve told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that. He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I’ll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.
(Applause)
GEORGE H. BUSH: I still have a couple of minutes left. And there is a difference principle –
LEHRER: Sorry, Vice President.
GEORGE H. BUSH: It’s only on yellow here. Wait a minute.
(Laughter)
LEHRER: I’m wrong. Go ahead. My apologies.
