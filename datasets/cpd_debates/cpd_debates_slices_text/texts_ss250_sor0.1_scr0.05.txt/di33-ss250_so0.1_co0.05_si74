ROBERT DOLE: ... don’t mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal. I’ve just finished reading a book, I think it’s called — what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration. Whether it’s organized labor or whether it’s the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether it’s the labor unions or whatever. And so I think you take a look at it. The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he’d recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what’s going to happen to them. They’ve all got a lot of anxieties out there. Did anybody complain when you raised taxes? Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money? That’s why we want an economic package. We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies. That’s what our message is to the people watching. Not all this back and forth, you voted this way, you voted that way, we want a better America as we go into the next century.
