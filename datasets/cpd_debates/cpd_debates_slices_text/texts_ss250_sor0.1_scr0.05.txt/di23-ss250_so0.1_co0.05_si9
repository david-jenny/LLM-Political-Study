MICHAEL PENCE: ... . But when you say what the American people have done over these last eight months hasn’t worked, that’s a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made.
KAMALA HARRIS: I’m referring to your president.
MICHAEL PENCE: The reality – If I may, if I may finish, Senator. The reality is Dr. Fauci said everything that he told the President in the Oval Office, the President told the American people. Now President Trump I will tell you has boundless confidence in the American people and he always spoke with confidence that we’d get through this together. But when you say it hasn’t worked – when Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birks and our medical experts came to us in the second week of March, they said if the President didn’t take the unprecedented step of shutting down roughly half of the American economy that we could lose 2.2 million Americans. That’s the reality.
PAGE: Thank you. Thank you, Vice President Pence –
MICHAEL PENCE: They also said to us if we did everything right, Susan, we could still lose more than 200,000 Americans.
