ALBERT GORE: ... guy is turned out of power. Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea. But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I’m not sure it’s right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this — this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that. They currently favor going forward with a runoff election. I think that’s the wrong thing. I think the governor’s instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there. But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.
GEORGE W. BUSH: Well obviously we wouldn’t use the Russians if they didn’t agree with our answer, Vice President.
ALBERT GORE: They donâ€™t.
GEORGE W. BUSH: Let me say this to you, I wouldn’t use force. I wouldn’t use force.
