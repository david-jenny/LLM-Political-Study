But our long-term security depends on our deep faith in liberty. And we’ll continue to promote freedom around the world.
Freedom is on the march. Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president. In Iraq, we’ll be having free elections, and a free society will make this world more peaceful.
God bless.
GIBSON: President, Senator Kerry, that concludes tonight’s debate.
I want to give you a reminder that the third and final debate on issues of domestic policy will be held next Wednesday, October 13th, at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, hosted by Bob Schieffer of CBS News.
I want to thank President Bush and Senator Kerry for tonight. I want to thank these citizens of the St. Louis area who asked the questions, who gave so willingly of their time, and who took their responsibility very seriously.
Thank you also to everyone at Washington…
(APPLAUSE)
I want to thank everyone at Washington University in St. Louis for being such gracious hosts.
I’m Charles Gibson from ABC News. From St. Louis, good night.
