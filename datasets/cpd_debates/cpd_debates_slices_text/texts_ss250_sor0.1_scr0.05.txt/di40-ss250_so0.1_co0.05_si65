PAUL RYAN: No, we’re not just going to cut the defense budget like they’re — they’re proposing…
JOE BIDEN: They’re going to increase it $2 billion.
PAUL RYAN: That’s not…
(CROSSTALK)
PAUL RYAN: We’re talking about… RADDATZ: So no massive defense increases?
PAUL RYAN: No, we’re saying don’t — OK, you want to get into defense now?
RADDATZ: Yes, I do. I do, because that’s another math question.
PAUL RYAN: So — right, OK.
RADDATZ: How do you do that?
PAUL RYAN: So they proposed a $478 billion cut to defense to begin with. Now we have another $500 billion cut to defense that’s lurking on the horizon. They insisted upon that cut being involved in the debt negotiations, and so we have a $1 trillion cut…
RADDATZ: Let’s put the automatic defense cuts aside, OK?
PAUL RYAN: Right, OK.
